I don't think there is a general distinction.  Rather, there are
two classes of chronic hepatitis: chronic active hepatitis and chronic
persistent hepatitis.  I can't think of any other disease where the
term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic.

Much as these two terms ""chronic active"" and ""chronic persistent""
sound fuzzy, the actual distinction between the two conditions
is often fairly fuzzy as well.

Precisely.  One wonders what unusual strain the boy might be under that
could be causing ""difficulty with his behavior"".  Standard practice would
be to get a second opinion from a child psychiatrist.  One would want to
rule out the possibility that the ""bad behavior"" is not psychiatric
illness at all.

 New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at
Huntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported
 To: National Desk, Health Writer
 Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, or
          800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research
          Institutes.

   LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing 
and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain
which lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been
discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research
Institutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their research
will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,
Radiology.
   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led
by Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly
patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of
dementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special
software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical
Proton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses
in less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton
MRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination
time yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10
minutes.  By comparison, the current ""standard of care"" in testing
for Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and
neuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the
patient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.
   In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS
exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including
AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's
disease.
   ""We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly
and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted
with either the MRS or PROBE software,"" said Dr. Ross, adding,
""this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and
intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease
causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.""
   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the
brain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker
in the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed
with Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their
level of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was
significantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons
believed to be associated with the progression of the disease.
   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely
considered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross
believes, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an
interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to
the nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15
years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based
on the changing receptors for acetylcholine.
   ""Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate
Alzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or
her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment
protocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we
consider this test a major advancement in medicine,"" said Bruce
Miller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher
and a co-author of the study.
   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,
Ph.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,
R.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200
General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,
and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.
   For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology
May issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or
Belinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.

   Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:

   What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of
the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist
Alois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of
memory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,
loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.
   How many people does it affect?
   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in
the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking
approximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's
debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both
emotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the
most common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every
year, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.
   What are its signs and symptoms?
   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have
been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk
of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50
yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life
to reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial
AD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of
developing AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe ""forgetfulness""
caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School
of Medicine at New York University says ""whether forgetfulness is
a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree"" and
suggests the following criteria:

   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is
      normal.
   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.
   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.
   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.

   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be
evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms
of dementia.

VW and Mercedes have tinkered with particulate traps.  Also, VW
uses a kind of turbocharger on their Jetta ECOdiesel that helps
reduce particulates as well, although I don't know the
mechanics of it.

Many diesel cars,busses, and trucks in Europe are now being
equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up
diesel emissions, already well below legal limits anyway.

It's a shame GM had to soil the diesel's reputation in
passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to
research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even
further ahead of gas engines in emissions.

Please help.

I have an IBM-compatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen.  While I
was working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little,
which I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer and
all peripherals.  It only did this for a second and then stopped.

I left the room for several minutes and, when I returned, the screen was
completely dim, not blank, but very very dim.  The contrast slider still
worked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out what
was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.

I was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I still
tried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc.,
all to no avail.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that I
need to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the
""death"" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually
happened.  I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the
net about this because I already know what they'll say: ""Yep, you gotta have
this replaced and it's gonna cost you $???.""

I've only had the computer for about 21 months.  Is that a reasonable life
cycle for a LCD display?  Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: the
brand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it's a 386SX @ 20 MHz.
I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down
before coming in to work today.

If anyone can help me, PLEASE give me any advice you might have.  I'm not
opposed to having it replaced, but I'd rather not if it's not absolutely
necessary.  If you wouldn't mind, please e-mail me at mike@mik.uky.edu
but if you'd rather post I'll be checking back here in a couple of days.

BTW, if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere, feel
free to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location and
name of the FAQ if you don't mind.

Thanks in advance for any help...

Subject: eros in LXX: concluding lexicographic note
Organization: PANIX Public Access Unix, NYC
Lines: 58

This might be better directed to s.r.c.bible-study, which I have begun
reading, but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum, I will
conclude here as well.  A week ago, I managed to find time to consult
a Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,
and I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as
used in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the
Jewish scriptures.

The principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal
noun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning ""lover.""  This cluster occurs just
where one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)
of Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea
2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel
16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.

	[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and
	  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not
	  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]

The ""erotic"" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is
evident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like
""of the arts"" the word ""lover"" is going to have an overtone of sexual
relationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see
that standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the
Hebrew! :-)

More interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine
usage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),
_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very
valuable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd
context -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be ""say.""

In addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),
Esther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, 

	kai e:rasthe"" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther

and, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of
support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:

	kai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra
	-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely

	[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I
	  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]

(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about
the ""historical"" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of
the Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the
""erotic"" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_
for erotic senses, this need not mean anything ""more"" than _agapao:_ alone
would mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this
translator goes!)

There is no question of similarity in Jesus indication about John.
The passage in Matthew is very direct.  Where Luke (1:17) reports
the angel Gabriel prophesying that John will go before Christ ""in the 
power and spirit of Elias"", In Matthew 11: 14, Jesus himself says of John,
   
   ""And if you care to accept it, he himself is Elijah, who
    was to come"".

It is interesting that Jesus prepended the words, ""If you care to accept
it"", as if to say that the implications of this truth, namely of rein-
carnation, I will not force on you, but for those who can accept it, here it
is.  A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other
topics has outlined the esoteric, cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of
reincarnation and Karma, a teaching that is little known among Jews
today, but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah
Hurnard (""Hinds Feet on High Places"") was told about it by a Rabbi
she was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine.
Thus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this,
whereas the large number of people did not.  The statement of Jesus about 
John, the greatest human personality in the New Testament, is guarded
but nevertheless quite direct.  Again, the subject of reincarnation, one
way or another, is not a subject of the New Testament, nor is the fate in general
of the human being between death and the last judgement.  But there are 
occasional indications that point to it.

As for the ""popular belief"" that Elijah would come again, it was more than 
a popular belief, as Jesus confirms it in more than one place, and he never 
corrected those who were expecting Elijah --  for example, those who thought 
that Jesus himself be he.

1954 MG-TF with frame-up restoration in early '70's - a local show winner!
Driven very little and stored inside since then - mostly collected dirt &
dust.  Needs attention to brake cylinders (like all MG-T's) but otherwise
ready to run.  Chrome & paint not fancy but it is mechanically excellent.
The engine, a 1250cc, was completely overhauled by a machine shop.  It is
priced at $12,000.

1953 MG-TD Good shape but hasn't been run since '70's.  Needs engine work,
but no rust and everything is with it including a top, side curtains and
carpet that were new and haven't seen the outdoors since the '70's. $9,500.

1952 MG-TD Basket Case.  I'd call it a parts car, but it's too good
for that.  Everything seems to be there except the tach.  Would make
a good project car or parts car if you insist.  No apparent rust but the
upholstery is a disaster.  Stored inside since the '70's.  The top was
new but now soso.  This one has wire wheels!  Looking for $4,500.

All three cars will be sold ""as they stand"" with no hassles or haggles.
Time has passed by and it is time to part company.  Prices are negotiable.

	annual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite,
	which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the
	proceedings and the art show catalog, essentially.

	TOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate.

	Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI
	membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings,
	these are now an extra cost option.  Bundling that back into the basic
	rate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost.

	SIGOIS membership cost has up 33%, but they've also split out the
	Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to
	be included with membership.  Adding that cost back in means this SIG
	also has doubled its membership fee.

What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago
touting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it
sound like they were offering NEW services.  But with the exception of a couple,
like SIGGRAPH, all the ""plus"" services appear to be just splitting the costs
into smaller piles so that they don't look so big.  But their recommended
changes to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31%
increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31%
inflation rate on the publications I got last year.

Is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as I am?

re: extended Ka bands.

I recently bought a 2 band detector.  You guys must all think I'm
nuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this
area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state
as well as surrounding states.  Here's how I found out:

- A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know 
  what Ka is.  He's heard of K, which is what they use here and I
  explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,
  ""Ka stands for K automatic""... duuhh.  He then went on to say that
  plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high
  tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much.

- My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,
  even the real sneaky ones.

- When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here
  or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used
  a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.

So in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting
months for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high
performance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equal
to their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know that
Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I've never fully
relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at
least quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.

See the rec.pets.cats FAQ or any doctor or vet for more information.

I am not any of the above, but we do have a couple of cats.

It is transmitted through the fecal matter, so a pregnant woman should
avoid cleaning the cat tray and you should both wash hands before

Apart from that, its no great problem.  You certainly do not need to

Some GT-40s are street legal, some aren't.

I found my Shelby-American guide. There were a grand total 126 GT-40s
built:
		GT-40 Coupes		55
		GT-40 Road Cars		31
		GT-40 Mk II		13
		GT-40 Mk IIIs		 7
		GT-40 Roadsters		 5
		Mirages			 3
		GT-40 Mk IVs		12
		   	TOTAL:	       126
		Additional uncompleted Mk IIIs	6-12

Twelve of these cars were prototypes; 48 racing coupes; 31 road coupes;
eight Mk II coupes; 4 LHD Mk IIIs; and 3 RHD Mk IIIs. The other 
breakdowns follow the above list (eg, 12 were Mk IVs). The LHD/RHD
breakdown is only given on the Mk IIIs.

The prices (for those which can be bought) are around the $1 Million
mark, last I heard, with a projection of some $3.5 Million (or
thereabouts) in 2000. It was second only to some penny-ante Ferarri ;-).

Shelby won the FIA World Manufacturer's Cup with his Cobras in '65; that
was also the year that he retired them from the Shelby-American racing
team (in favor of the Ford GT program the next year). That victory
broke a 13(?) year Ferarri winning streak.

Well, there's lotsa info I could spout, but I'll refrain. Much of
this information comes from ""Hot Rod"" magazine's ""Shelby American
Cobra/Mustang Guide,"" which has more info on the Shelby-American 
Fords than you could _ever_ want to know.

I've seen children do this and wondered about something.  If the
mucus in one's nose collects (filters) particles going into the
airway, if a child then picks and ingests this material, might
it have a vaccinatory effect, since if the body ingests airborne

Maybe this is why some children don't get sick very often? :-)

LOVE IN THE MORNING  (Psalm 90:14)

by Malcolm Smith

Moses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel. A generation
before the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,
gateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather
than God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would
have given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their
decision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the
land of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-
makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and
destined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the
time they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers
had been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a
sigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they
were going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.
Whatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached
bones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of
hopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation
at Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The
forty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those
who were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the
inheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses
prays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.
All these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining
people through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.
His was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but
he also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was
that they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. ""Who is your
God?"" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When
Aaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young
bull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull
who had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led
Israel to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow
thin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water
gushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the
God of Almightiness becomes ""ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?""
And a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might
be all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right
to do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people
had known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung
on the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed
God could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM
and, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His
acts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the
day of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.
At Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He
had seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This
request was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious
Person. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and
lovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word ""lovingkindness"" is not to be
understood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship
arising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the
love that says, ""I will never leave you nor forsake you."" Lovingkindness is as
tenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its
heels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on
feelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,
therefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion
that wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our
highest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God
does not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings
of love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with
us! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him
to reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not
because of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed
to us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will
not let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--
but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is
saying to the recipient, ""For as long as we shall live, I am for you.""  The God
who has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in
His coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is
lovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never
leave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as
love; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing
miracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the
heart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.
Moses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for
these people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they
could not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out
of knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who
gives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to
miss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If
man is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on
knowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from
love demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of
meaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to
know the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the
possibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The
language Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its
mother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is
waking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,
protected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were
to ask, ""What has the baby done to deserve this?"" or, ""Have arrangements
been made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?"" Our
questions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was
conceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love
that has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is
unconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child
or its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,
spontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after
His image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the
Lord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to
earn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity
through the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a
scientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if
it survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been
held and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the
embrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new
generation will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in
the love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and
gladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His
love. ""Satisfied."" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing
being filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe
the earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received
enough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be
drenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the
lifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our
deepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems
disappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling
that he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make
sense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this
satisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the
emotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in
religious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding
to the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life
make sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again
became the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it
fascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His
love. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would
think he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by
the knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew
better. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't
find it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to
manipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and
give us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes
and satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God
to make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially
answered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which
worked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its
fullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the
love of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,
we read of the Holy Spirit ""falling upon"" the believers. This is an ancient
expression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in
Luke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and ""falling on his
neck and kissing him."" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest
self and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your
being. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.
Moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization
that we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught
us to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a
state of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance
and love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love
we cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy
Spirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to
think on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded
with the doctrine of ""perform to be accepted."" We begin to realize that He
loves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge
everyone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your
eyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not
feel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the
other day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept
behind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays
without being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing
that we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to
Moses, ""joy and gladness all our days."" Joy is the result of a life that is
functioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say
that joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest
performance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and
the result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now
has in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,
in joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.

A dealer will make money off you in three ways, if you let him:

	1)  New car markup over his cost (remember his hold-back),
	2)  Arranging financing through the dealership, and
	3)  Screwing you on the trade.

Keep the deal with the dealer simple by eliminating 2 & 3.  Buying a car at 
""dealer's cost"" is meaningless if he makes $1000 on the trade and/or gets a 
kickback from the bank.

Blue book (you need to know if you're talking average wholesale or average 
retail) is a good guide to value for a car.  If you are selling it yourself, 
try to get average retail, and chances are you'll have done ok.

Be careful selling to acquaintances if you ever want them to become friends.

	Often times (most recently on this list in the last few days) I've
heard the passage from revelation:

	""...whoever adds to the sacred words of this book...whoever removes

	 used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books.

	 I feel this is ridiculous for two reasons:

	 1.  They weren't added later by the Catholic Church; they were
		*always* part of what was considered inspired scripture.
		(This has been dealt with in previous postings...no reason
		to repeat the info.)

	2.  It is more likely than not that when St. John (or whomever) wrote
		the book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was
		** NOT ** the same thing you and I are holding in our hands!

	If one takes the translation of ""this book"" in REV 18:22 (or somewhere
	around there) to mean ""all of scripture"", then all of us are likely
	holding something that is in violation of this command.

	It is impossible to exactly date the scriptures, even the N.T. ones
	(they didn't like to date their letters, I guess).  I really wish I
	had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight, but I believe
	that several of the N.T. letters, chief among them 2 Peter, have their
	most likely date of composition in the early second century A.D.
		Revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of 
	Domition (sp?), A.D. 80-96.  Thus it could be argues that we are all
	in sin if we accept 2 Peter as scripture, since it was ""added"" to the

Maybe before Babel,everyone including angels spoke the same language,so at
Babel, God punished us by giving us languages different from the original one.
So if that's the case,then angels now would be speaking in the tongue  mankind
spoke before Babel.

There is a known problem with the seals on the taillights of <93 probes.
Complain loudly to your dealer and get them to install new seals.  It is
a known problem, present on most (if not all) pre-93 Probes, so you 
shouldn't have to pay them to fix it.  In my case, they fixed it on
my extended warranty (I just had to pay a $50 deductable) (the
work was valued at something like $185 with labor and parts).  Having
removed the tail lamps myself on other occasions, I think their estimate
was fair.

    Yes.  There are many methods of rendering, raytracing is one of them.
You didn't say what you mean by rendering, so I won't guess.  Methods of

        o  Pencil and graph paper, doing the math by hand

        o  Wireframe rendering of the 2D projection

Significant progress has been made recently in shape analysis using
neural networks and the energy minimization concept. Ablex Publishing
Corporation is planning a special volume on ""Shape Analysis"", scheduled
for this year.

This volume will be a part of ""Progress in Neural Networks,"" an annual
book series reviewing research in modelling, analysis, design and
application of neural networks. The primary aim of this volume is to
present, in a single volume, the most important achievements made on
this important topic, which are otherwise scattered in diverse literature.

Authors are invited to submit original manuscripts detailing recent
progress. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: shape modelling,
shape estimation, shape recovery, shape representation, shape matching,
surface reconstruction and surface decomposition. Research work utilizing
neural networks directly or based on energy minimization techniques such as
Markov random field, mean field annealing, simulated annealing, graduated
non-convexity algorithms and resistive networks are most welcome.

The paper should be tutorial in nature, self contained and preferably,
but not necessarily, about fifty double spaced pages in length. Please send
electronically (if you prefer, you can send a hardcopy to the address below)
an  abstract and an outline to

Hm. I get a little queasy around the phrase ""aren't morally 
responsible"", perhaps because I've heard it misused so many times.
(I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who
was drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) In general,
most folk can't control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day
and think about has some impact on them, hm? And I'm not sure what
""actions"" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant
about the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as
our actions. Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally
responsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important
part of that.

I don't know a thing about Out Of Body Experiences. I've had dreams, some
fairly vivid ones; is an OOBE just a very vivid dream? I would argue that
extreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky; it is probably
much better to think about who Jesus is, and who we are in relation to that,
than to cultivate a strong interest in dreams. Unless you feel plagued by
dreams that are painful and out of control; then pray about it and/or get help.

>2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')
>Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in
>common by more than one person.
What on Earth is your definition of ""often""? I know exactly one case of
two people who had substantially the same dream at the same time, and
as they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could
see why their dreams might be similiar. Anyway, the only ""other plane"" I
know of is the spiritual realm. I don't think *anyone's* dreams,
perhaps outside the occasional prophet's, represent actual actions on an
alternate plane. If they were real actions, or conscious thoughts, then
yes they would have direct moral significance.

>3) Like (2), but here we assume that [garbled text: ""because the dream occurs
in a different environment, then different moral laws apply"" is my guess of
what you said.]
I don't see the slightest hint in Christian writings that ones ""environment""
changes the way a person determines what is moral. For a Christian won't
it *always* come down to ""what Jesus would have us do?""

>So... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know
>of another alternative?  respond by post or email.
Truth? I don't claim to be an expert in dreams. I'll note that the Bible
doesn't talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak
to us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as it
warns somewhere in the OT. Given that, I would not give them a lot of
attention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something.

I would discount talk of ""alternate planes,"" though. The only places such
concepts are commonly bandied about are for the most part hostile to
Christianity, though I've run into the occasional exception. If you are,
or want to be, a Christian, you want to be very careful about ideas like
this.

There is a contradiction related to the moral issue of polygamy in the
Mormon writings.  In the book in the book of Mormon called the book of 
Jacob, Joseph Smith wrote that it was an abomination to God for 
David and Solomon to have many wives.  Later, when Joseph Smith wrote
the Doctrines and Covenants (possibly when polygamy was becoming an
issue in his personal life) he wrote that it was not an abomination for
David to have many wives.  How do Mormons answer this contradiction?

This may sound argumentative, but do the pro-homosexual crowd give the
same support to church members that are involved in incestuous relationships?
If we do a little substitution above, we get:

""although by no means all episcopalians are sympathetic to incestuous
men and women, there certainly is a fairly larget percentage (in my
experience) who are.  I am good friends with an episcopalian minister
who is ordained and living in a monogamous incestual relationship.  This
in no way diminishes his ability to minister -- in fact he has a very
significant ministry with the Incest association of his community...""

Do the same standards apply?  If not, why not?  And while we're in the
ballpark, what about bestiality?  I can't recall offhand if there are
any direct statements in the Bible regarding sex with animals; does that
activity have more or less a sanction?

Please avoid responses such as ""you're taking this to extremes"".  I would
guess that a disproportionate percentage of the inerrant Bible community
views homosexual acts with distaste in the same manner that society at
large views incest.

[ Obviously you can replace homosexuality in the above statement by
anything from murder to sleeping late.  That doesn't mean that the
same people would accept those substitutions.  The question is whether
the relationships involved do in fact form an appropriate vehicle to
represent Christ's relationship to humanity.  This is at least
*partly* an empirical question.  

In some cases types of human relationship have been rejected because
over time they always seem to lead to trouble.  I think that's the
case with slavery.  One can argue that in theory, if you follow Paul's
guidelines, it's possible to have Christian slaveholders.  But in
practice, over a period of time, most people came to the conclusion
that nobody can really have that degree of control over another and
not abuse it.  

The message you were responding to was asking you to look at the
results from Christian communities that endorse homosexuality.  (Note:
Christian homosexuals, not people you see on the news advocating some
extremist agenda).  You may not want to base your decision completely
on that kind of observation, but I would argue that it's at least
relevant.  You can't answer the request by asking why you shouldn't
look at the Incest association, because in fact there is no such
association.  If there were, it might be reasonable for you to look at
it too.  Of course that doesn't mean that the results of all such
examinations would necessarily come out the same way.  Part of why
there aren't groups pushing all possible relaxed standards is that
some of them do produce obviously bad results.

>Does anyone now where an English translation of the long recension of
>the Acts of the Apostles can be found?

1] A english translation of this can be found in:
   ""The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an
   introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance"", J. M. Wilson
   (London, 1923).

2] Another work that might be useful is:
   ""The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and
   Notes on Selected Passages"", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;
   reprinted 1970).

(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the
text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it
actually contains an english translation or not.)

3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:
   ""The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in
   Acts"", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).

4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the
early '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)

5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if
you're interested in examining the differences in the long recension
an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:
   ""A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT"", Bruce Metzger (United Bible
   Society, 1971).

Metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of
the Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went
behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in
the UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are
included in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).

In particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:
   ""[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full
   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and
   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...
   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the
   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the
   evidence that supports the divergent readings."" (p 272).

>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has
>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the
>differences are between the long and the short forms.

6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the
ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter
(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is
usually called the ""Western"" version and its main witness is the Codex
Bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).

7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition
(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the
text edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains
18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.

8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations
in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main
difference seems to ""expansion"" of detail in the Western text (or, if
you prefer ""contractions"" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems
to be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific
cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.

9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the
more authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything
approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents
purely the ""authentic"" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be
examined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the
Alexandrian text is the ""better"" more often than not.

I would say only to the extent that the Roman Catholic Church
neither approves nor disapproves of capital punishment, as
confirmed in the recent catechism, though there are many RCs
who were rather surprised and upset that capital punishment was
not explicitly condemned.

For myself, as a Catholic, I see my own opposition to capital
punishment as much the same as my opposition to abortion - a
reverence for life. Here in the UK, the anti-abortion case is
often let down by the explicit link which those on the
political left make with anti-abortionists and
pro-executionists. There is a tendency to condemn people who
hold both views as hypocrites. I feel that if there were many
more anti-abortionists who were also vocal in their opposition
to capital punishment on a pro-life line, it would end this
kneejerk association of anti-abortion as a right-wing thing,
and get many to think seriously about the issue (there are
plenty who are pro-abortion equally for a kneejerk left-wing
reason).

I do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken
as support for capital punishment. I take it that as a Roman
Catholic you are opposed to abortion, and would still onsider
it wrong, and something to be objected to even if legalised by
""authority"".

Perhaps all of us hackers have become (ICK) PROFESSIONALS?  I have noticed
my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals.
It is rather distasteful.  It occurs when a series of things happen:

   1) one's ego outgrows one's talent/knowledge
   2) one's financial situation takes precedence
   3) A change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)
   4) the hacker's attitude makes the shift from ""fun"" to ""work""
   5) one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for ""the hobby""

or the biggest killer (IMO)

   6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's
      version of reality.  Without the dream the motivation dies, without
      the motivation the effort seems useless.

Another set of problems stems from our children.  While most of us remember
when there were several completely different computer systems, our children
are growing up with just a few choices (MSDOS/Mac/Amiga) and do not enjoy
the diversity we did.  I remember the great computer fallout of the early
eighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems
that were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely
divergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn new
systems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program was
needed we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a
commercial offering was just not available.  Now our children are being
taught the ""user"" mentality.  As the number of us ""old-timers"" dwindle we are
not being replaced by the next generation.

prognosis, but otherwise identical clinical features?

           Cornell Theory Center Summer School
 
          Offered through the Cornell School of
        Continuing Education and Summer Sessions
 
                  Course Description
 
 Within the past ten years, the  simulation and  modeling of
Lines: 197

molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into
a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a
decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to
build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.
 
While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their
own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,
simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.
Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms
and technological advances in graphical computing.
 
This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap
between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry
researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of
prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to
be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets
from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students
will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises
and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming
(IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have
access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video
recording equipment.
 
Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological
           sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art
           computer graphics into their research; computer scientists
           wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of
           scientific visualization.
 
           The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a
           first-come first-served basis.
 
Level:     Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits. May be taken
           without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra
           and introductory chemistry required. Familiarity with Unix,
           X-windows and C is useful but not required.
 
Date:   June 14-25, 1993  (2 Credits)
        June 14-18, 1993  (1 or 0 credits)
 
Time:   Mon-Fri 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm
 
Cost:   0 or 1 credit       $410
        2 credits           $820
 
Format
 
The course will be held in the Theory Center training facility
where computer workstations will be available.  Daily lectures will be
interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided
for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing
environment. Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis
of their laboratory exercises and short final project. Those enrolled
for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be given
more time for project development and meet daily to share experience
and discuss problems encountered.
 
Content (may vary)
 
    Elements of computer graphics
         polygonal rendering, lighting models, ray tracing, volumetric
         rendering, stereo graphics, animation, introduction to data-flow

	Hahahahahaha.  *gasp*  *pant*  Hm, I'm not sure whether the above
was just a silly remark or a serious remark.  But in case there are
some misconceptions, I think Henry Robertson hasn't updated his data
file on Korea since...mid 1970s.  Owning a car in Korea is no longer
a luxury.  Most middle class people in Korea can afford a car and do
have at least one car.  The problem in Korea, especially in Seoul, is
that there are just so many privately-owned cars, as well as taxis and
buses, the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there is
no place to park.  Last time I heard, back in January, the Kim Administration
wanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide
his or her own parking area, just like they do in Japan.

	Also, Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai isn't the only
car manufacturer in Korea.  Daewoo has always manufactured cars and
I believe Kia is back in business as well.  Imported cars, such as
Mercury Sable are becoming quite popular as well, though they are still
quite expensive.

	Finally, please ignore Henry's posting about Korean politics
and bureaucracy.  He's quite uninformed.

'63 to '82 vettes had the same basic chassis. 1980 add aluminum (weaker) 
rear 'axle' housing.  All these years used same brakes, similar springs etc
  Late 70's was a bad year for GM reliability.  Catastrophic converter was

My origional inquires to my insurance agent: I can drive my '69 convertable

Get an appraiser to look at the car. He will check serial numbers and look 
for origional equipe.  Depending on what mods have been done the car could 
be worth only 10K.  Problems like wrong engine / trans.  Wrong paint type (
vetts used lacquer)  An modification would reduce tthe value.  But your 
looking for a car to drive right?

This sounds like a ball park price for a small-block (327 cu in.) / manual 
/ no air car.  A 427 would put it closer to $30K.

Get it appraised!!!  For insurance purposes also.

Maybe you should dig a little further Charles.  Hislop's scholarship was
accepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premere
Institute for Oriental studies.  As I've stated over and over,  I've checked
out about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private
libraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THey
too came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will
find that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both were
highly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one of
the leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still
being refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He
was recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  

Phony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have
misquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions
do not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his
conclusions are ""spurious"" is without merit.  He gave references to all his
conclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his
conclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the
individual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to
Hislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions
because they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that
the intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown
even to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in
Corinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it
was so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of
seven hills?

Also, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own
conclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the
docrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don't even
have to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre. 
Where did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two
tails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from
an earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the
church of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,
why did the RCC chose regardless?

Any lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the
scriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information
from all the various sources and put them in one binding.  There is no lack of
scholorship in that.

Please tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present no
evidence supporting it.

Subject: Definition of Christianity?
Organization: Silicon Graphics, St. Louis, MO
Lines: 84

I have enrolled in ""The History of Christianity"" at a college here in
St. Louis. The teacher of the class is what I consider to be
closed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of
Christianity is.  His definition is tied directly to that of the
Trinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief in
Jesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian.

While his saying it doesn't make it so,  I nevertheless feel insulted
(or am I just neurotic? :^) ). I would like to be able to respond to
him with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable
student-teacher relationship.

So, is there common definition of what Christianity is?  As the
previous discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange
of flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major
flames.

Regards,
--
Larry Autry

autry@sgi.com 



[Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately
there are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the 
broadest, commonly used definitions are:

  a historical definition
  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior
  a broad doctrinal definition
  narrow doctrinal definitions

1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular
historian would likely use.  This would include any group that
developed out of the Christian church, and continues within the same
broad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any
doctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group
developed from Christianity, and people from very different
backgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of
Christianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's
relevant in some political and ethnic contexts.

2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many
Christian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and
Presbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what
most people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that
someone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's
an attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based
on technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians
would be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the
modern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and ""oneness
Pentecostals"".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but
still Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls
into this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.

3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,
which includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes
groups that are felt to be outside ""historic Christianity.""  This is
of course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that
Protestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the
most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the
Nicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to
characterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree
are key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A
Mormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not
want to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think
this definition would have fairly broad acceptance.

4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited
to a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only
consider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style
conversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit
it to their specific church.

I think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.
A lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If
you're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll
probably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.
to say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use
a definition like 3 or even 4.

The use of shock waves (not ultrasound) to break up stones has been

I beg to differ.  Chronic *active* hepatitis implies that the disease

the patient has HbSag in his/her blood and can transmit the infection, but

This file is crossposted to comp.graphics, comp.answers and news.answers,
so if you can't locate it in comp.graphics, you're advised to search in
comp.answers or news.answers
(The latter groups usually are archived in your site. Contact your sysadmin
for more info).

These 3 articles are posted to comp.graphics 3-4 times a month and are kept in
many places (see below)

--

Many FAQs, including this one, are available on the archive site
pit-manager.mit.edu (alias rtfm.mit.edu) [18.172.1.27] in the directory
pub/usenet/news.answers.  The name under which a FAQ is archived appears
in the Archive-name line at the top of the article.
This FAQ is archived as graphics/resources-list/part[1-3]

There's a mail server on that machine. You send a e-mail message to
mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu  containing: help in the Subject: field

1. ARCHIE
=========

The Archie is a service system to locate FTP places for
requested files. It's appreciated that you will use Archie
before asking help in the newsgroups.

Archie servers:
  archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)
  archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)
  archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)
  cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)

  archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)

Connect to Archie server with telnet and type ""archie"" as username.
To get help type 'help'.
You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie
without the burden of a telnet session.
'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc,
vol. 27.

To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with
subject ""help"" to ""archie"" account at any of above sites.

(Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is
accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].
Connect to it and specify ""archie"" as the host name and ""archie"" as
the username.)

2. Notes
========
(Excerpted from the FAQ article)

Please do *not* post or mail messages saying ""I can't FTP, could
someone mail this to me?""  There are a number of automated mail servers
that will send you things like this in response to a message.

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"",
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

4. Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes
===========================================

Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help.
Don't overuse mail servers.

There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these
mail servers have a command like
   path a_valid_return_e-mail_address
to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.

DEC's FTPMAIL
-------------
  Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,
  and having a line containing the word 'help'.
  You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you
  must follow in order to get the files you want.

  Note that the ""reply"" or ""answer"" command in your mailer will not work
  for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send
  requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.
  Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com
  address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not
  responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.

BITFTP
------
  For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.
  Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.

Lightwave 3D mail based file-server
-----------------------------------
  A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images
  and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.
  The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list
  and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for
  several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.

  The server resides on a BBS called ""The Graphics BBS"".  The BBS is
  operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1
  908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144
  V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.

  If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,
  please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:
  server@bobsbox.rent.com.

  For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message
  to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in
  the body of the message:
    HELP
    /DIR
  And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete
  directory listing will be sent to you via mail.

[ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it
 out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]

INRIA-GRAPHLIB
--------------
  Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail
  server a few months ago.

    echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and 
  how to browse among its files.

    echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the extended summary.

  As an other example :

    echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from
  comp.graphics.

BBSes
-----
  There are many BBSes that store datafiles, etc.etc., but a guide to these
  is beyond the scope of this Listing (and the resources of the author!)

7. Scene description languages
==============================

NFF
---
  Neutral file format , by Eric Haines. Very simple, there are some
  procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects
  floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in
  HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can
  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.
  (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)

OFF
---
  Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com).
[ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,
 I'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]

  Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this
  service, send a message with a ""Subject:"" line containing only the word
  ""help"" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.
  [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF
  previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in
  godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,
  also on gondwana.

TDDD
----
It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF,
Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects.
Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):

  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley
  (worley@cup.portal.com)

  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format
  called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,
  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely
  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.

  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file
  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the
  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially
  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various
  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,
  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables
  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views
  in Postscript.

P3D
---
  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight
  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp
  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to
  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.

  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon
  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D
  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.

  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:
  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,
  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from
  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.

  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines
  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory
  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.

RenderMan
---------
  Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.

8. Solids description formats
=============================

a. EEC's ESPRIT project 322 CAD*I (CAD Interfaces) has developed a
  neutral file format for transfer of CAD data (curves, surfaces, and
  solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA (Computer Aided
  Analysis) an CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)

b. IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid
  models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987
  For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at
  NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325
  and the cost is $100.
  This standard is not available in electronic format.

c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only
  the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.
  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get
  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov
  and putting the line
	send index
  in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.

  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working
  on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,
  both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.
  Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.

  For the tools contact Mike Mead, Phone: +44 (0235) 44 6710 (FAX: x 5893),
  e-mail: mm@inf.rl.ac.uk or {...!}mcsun!uknet!rlinf!mm or

Subject: Seeking info on retinal detachment
Organization: Acadia University
Lines: 40

I am quite near sighted.

I've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal
holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. In my
left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the
laser was used to ""weld"" this back in place as well.

My right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasional
flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since the
treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often
- several each hour.

The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the
vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. He
says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own
accord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment.

I am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments.
The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations
so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of most
interest to me:

If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course
of action?

If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is
the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect
afterwards.

Do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment
maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.

Many thanks

Can anyone give me information or lead me to electronic information (not
books; I'm too poor...) regarding programming the standard graphics modes?
320x200x4 and 640x200x2 are easy enough, but I'm not so sure about the
rest.  Something about planes or something, and writing to ports and the
like, but I don't know the numbers or anything -- for the 16 color modes, I
think.  If I'm wrong, let me know.  Also, 320x200x256 is just one byte/pixel;
that's easy enough, but are there any other ways to write to the screen,
perhaps bytes at a time, or something like that?

Of course, I'd appreciate any information about any mode....  which reminds
me of another question -- do the SuperVGA modes work the same, generally,
as the normal 16 and 256 color modes, or is not only the mode numbers
for various cards different, but the methods for writing to the screen
different as well?

Thanks for any help you can give me...  I'm developing a screen class for
C++ and find myself searching for information.  Oh, I do have Ralf Brown's
Interrupt List, which has given me tons of invaluable information already.
It just doesn't go into the screen programming details (except for the
read/write pixel BIOS calls...

Thanks again.

Utah raster toolkit using getx11. Convert your sun raster files (presumably) to 
ppm with the pbm+ toolkit then convert ppm to utah rle format with ppmtorle which
is provided in the toolkit.

I seem to remember that Xloadimage can do 24 bit servers too.

I'm not sure I agree with this 100%.  I agree that arrogance is not the result
of religion and that God is a far better judge than we are.  I also agree if
you mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one's
superior knowledge, rightness, or holiness over another person's beliefs.

I need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall
into the mistake of misrepresenting your views.  If I fall down in this area
I hope you will forgive me.

Arrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that
one's God is greater than the god's of others or of believing that one's
religion is better than other religions.  These are all naturally self-implied
beliefs.

It is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong.
Were I to find myself in error, my beliefs would naturally change and follow
what I believe to be right.  Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs
correct.  That's not arrogance.  That's unavoidable behavior.

It is nonsense to say that I believe another person's god to be greater than
my God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn't I be obligated to change so
that their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship
that God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to
worship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?

Arrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more
intelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No
doubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation
of one's superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.

Humility does not rest in slandering or belittling God's work of creation in
our lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another,
""I'm not very smart.  I'm poor.  I'm not good looking.  I'm just a worm in
the ground.  I'm such a weak person and although I don't want to sin, I
really cannot help it.""  Were this person truely humble, he would take a
different approach.  ""God, thank you for making me the way you did.  I know
that you never do anything second best.  Yet with all that you have given me,
I have been so unthankful.  You've given me power to resist the devil.  I
have not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said
not to do.  I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself
with humility for doing so.  Lord, with all you've given me, I have been
completely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness.  And, yet Your
love for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to
save me.  As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet it
pleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I've led.  Lord,
please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring
glory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord I'm so sorry for my wrongs.  Please
help me to change.""

: 
: I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because
: they don't want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically
: don't have anything to do with them.

For me, I've often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the
most humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most
proud ""worm in the ground"" false humility type person has been found to be
most comfortable company.

When I'm wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don't feel like
being confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with
my wrongness, I'd be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for
all their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.
At the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about
living my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me
silently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in
humility in private, I'd feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help
in changing from the error of my ways.

The hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone
regardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or
sincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.
It isn't easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity
to improve in one's ability to serve God.  It's easier to cast aside any hope
of reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God's creation
in our lives instead.

It seems that there are more and more ""bands"" available for
police radar each month.  I have recently purchased (within
the last 8 months) the BEL 966STW.  While it is not a perfect
detector by any means, it does do the job fairly well.  

Now, however, I pick up a car magazine at the airport and
read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of
the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors
was touted as covering.  

So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all
the usual bands (X, K, Ka photo, Ka wideband) as well as the
new Super Ka wideband.  

Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing
increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs (for
the average home consumer, at least), it seems that there is
now the same concern with radar detectors.  Does it make sense
to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my ""new"" detector?
Is Valentine upgrading their equipment?  If so, it might be 
worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine.  I was in the 
market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the
3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had
inadequate protection with my Passport.  Life was much simpler
when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best
equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously
shop for a new detector.  I hope that the flood of new radar 
bands ceases with this new Super Wideband business.

You Ford vs Chevy people must live in the planet of Detroit or Droid.

Like they say in the airforce, with enough horsepower anything will fly.

I can put a 32valve V-8 with twin Garret-4s on Yugo and get 7.7sec QM.
Thats useless ... Its still a Yugo that will loose any race on a track,
or on the street.

Have you Detroit beings compared the ultra-long-throw stick shifts of
the 5.0 with the 93 MR2 turbo or 93 RX7 (I ll buy it in 6 mos) ?

Or the Torsen differential of the RX7 compared to the Differential of 
the 5.0 that sounds in every hairpin turn ?

And bythe way 5.0 and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks ...

No smiley on the part about atheism, I see. Do you realize that your
statement says that I was mentioning ""nonsense"" about atheism? This is
hard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making, as you
have only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the
first. Please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it
out of hand. 
But, because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of English, I may be
misinterpreting your wording here. Please clarify: did you or did you not
mean to call my statements about atheism ""nonsense""? If so, care to back
up that claim?

OK, then. Start up the amatuer psycology again. How am I ""broken""?

>Is it politically correct for Christians to be the only besieged group
>permitted the luxury of arrogance?   

*YAWN* Excuse me, I don't recall any portion of my post in which I called
Christians arrogant quote me, if I did. I do remember calling Christianity
""silly"" and then following that up with information that I was nine years
old when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectually
dishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god's
existence. I define ""faith"" as ""belief in the absense of any proof"", BTW.

Also, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types
there, so in answer to your question: ""no.""

Finally, I'd hardly call Christianity ""beseiged"" in this country. I seldom
see Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing
crosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I don't know for sure, of
course, I only say I haven't seen it happening. What I have seen happening
is my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people
who claim to be Christ's followers. I know that this sort of thing isn't
practiced by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minority
who are doing it and I don't see comperable victimization of Christians. 

>Now I have a question for Bob.  Why in the world would any self-respecting
>atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group?  

The implication being that I am not self-respecting, of course. I'm not a
student of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing and
Linguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implications
I see are improper, please let me know.
I'm here because I'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as
you seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _don't_
think I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that
will change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see
""atheist"" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn't deserve
your respect?
Aw, geez. I'm sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high,
here. It's just that the ""nonsense"" thing really annoys me. I figure you
should see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to
your question.
Now, the smoothed feather version:
I seek all sorts of knowledge. That's why I came to my university. Yes, I
am looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of
Christian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view.
I've been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don't
know the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists
I figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist
motives here all you want (hence the ""amatuer"" psychology crack), but
without an atheist, you can't be sure of even one atheist's motive.       
I'm hoping people really
want to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several
religions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I
actually think about these things. Instead, I'm still faced with the
implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only ""broken""
people are atheist.
	Try it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural
state and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many
people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they 
discovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn't
follow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous
mix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend
to be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions
so successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which 
""breaks"" people.
It's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another
reason I'm here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as 
a watchdog for logical fallacies :).
>I have a

The implication here being that atheists can't possibly know anything
about Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my
reaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested that
atheists are ""broken"", hostile people. This post confirms that someone
else believes it.

Well, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of
evidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies
lack of existence. However, I haven't met the strong atheist yet who said
that nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a ""seeker"" if you like, I
don't. 
_Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say ""I
don't believe in any god"" rather than my position: ""I believe that no
god(s) exist."" For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve,
because they don't actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is
confusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and
Methodists from an atheist point of view :).
This is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in
something (followed up by ""everyone has faith in something""). Guess what?
My atheism ends the moment I'm shown a proof of some god's existence. Is
that really too much to ask?

Well, I guess you won't succeed in converting him or me. Why the

> I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it.
And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that
I can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how.
I have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe that's how I'm ""broken""?
I tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that
you should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of a
fundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you

Reading through the posts about Kirlian (whatever spelling)
photography I couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the
narrow-minded, ""I know it all"", ""I don't believe what I can't see or
measure"" attitude of many people out there.

I am neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever when it comes to
so-called ""paranormal"" stuff; but as far as I'm concerned, it is just
as likely as the existence of, for instance, a god, which seems to be
quite accepted in our societies - without any scientific basis.

I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to
something, ANYTHING, simply because it doesn't fit your current frame
of reference. History shows that many great people, great scientists,
were people who kept an open mind - and were ridiculed by sceptics.

                         OF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS

     Traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai (""homosexuals"") in 1 Cor 6:9
and 1 Tim 1:10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex,
specifically homosexualitiy.  Some restrict the term's meaning to ""active male
prostititute,"" but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,
namely ""homosexuals.""  More recently the definition ""homosexual"" has been
opposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term
""homosexuals"" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional
rendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes
heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. 
A concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only
factor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of
arsenokoitai by ""homosexuals"" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. 
Finally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it
from the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation
and behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline
(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).

                      *************************************

                                   INTRODUCTION

     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has
been an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or
sodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used
twice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous
scrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since
so much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, 
the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church
and in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.

     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and
evalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence
to point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the
modern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have
provoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider
acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the
ministry. 


Footnotes:
_______________________
 1.  For convenience sake, the term ""homosexual"" is used to encompass both
same-sex orientation and same-sex behavior.  The meaning of this term is one of
the main considerations of this study.
 2. These times are differnt from just over a century ago.  Then P Fairbairn
(Pastoral Epistles [Edinburg, 1874)  891) could write of arsenokoitai thit it
is a ""term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent."" 
Unknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and
study.  THe present writer endorses the Pauline authorship of the Pastoral
Epistles on the basis of internal and external evidence (see Donald Guthrie,
New Testament Introduction, [4th ed;  1990] 621-649, for an extensive
discussion and citation of supporters of the Pauline authorship).

Other Side (April 1984): 24-29.  For a study suggesting a further prohibition
of homosexuality in the OT, see A. Phillips, ""Unconvering the Father's Skirt,""

Insomnia is a known, but relatively infrequent, side-effect of
diphenhydramine.  

For most people, this does not occur.  On the other hand, most people
can build up a tolerance to an antihistamine with extended use.
(Allergy sufferers are often switched from one antihistamine to

This is a tricky situation; if the previous owner didn't inform
the dealer of the odometer change, then the previous owner committed
fraud, and he may be liable. The dealer may also be liable; If the
previous owner notified the dealer, or if the previous owner had the 
dash replaced at a dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash changed 
legally, any records search on the car should turn up the fact that
the odometer had been altered.  If a dealer changes the speedometer, he has
to report it (it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer,
and on the title, if I remember correctly; the dealer told me that
the old mileage, etc. were sent to Ford when my T-Bird's speedo 
was replaced). If the odometer can be set to the old mileage, it must 
be; if it can't (eg, electrically-driven odometers) then the mileage 
of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is 
affixed to the door frame of the vehicle. 

Either way, if the change had been done legally, then a records search
(which the dealer almost certainly did) should have turned it up.

While this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of
Christianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious
beliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma
to the point of misrepresentation.

There are significant differences in the idea of karma among Hindus,
Jains, Buddhists (and even among the various Buddhist traditions.)

To refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally
incorrect in the Buddhist and Jain traditions.  Karma is considered to
be a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape
a person's predilections for future intention and action and
produce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite --
""reward"" has nothing to do with it.  Both Jainism and Buddhism are atheistic
so there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments.  Karma is usually
described in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof.  In fact ""As you
sow, so shall you reap"" is found in the Pali Canon as I recall, the metaphor
of natural growth is explicit.

Hinduism, or some sects in that tradition, are I believe much more
deterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being
theistically inclined.

In point of fact, the Theravadin Buddhist tradition of Southeast Asia
considers karma as only one of five influences in human life, and in
fact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics
of karma without the element of free will.

Also in Eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and
rebirth, which is essentially absent in Western considerations.

Isn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation
among Christian thinkers?  What were his views, and how did he relate them
to the Christian scriptures?

Hmm.  This is certainly among the things I would refer to as quack
therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed
laetrile (whether licensed or not) as a quack.  There are unethical
behaviors (such as ordering unneccessary tests to increase fees)

 A recent CAR & DRIVER issue has an article about GEICO giving free

 enforcement.  The article also said that if you get a speeding ticket
 your premium will increase dramatically based on how much ""over the

 One accident claim and you will be dropped.

 0 claims, had an accident and filed an $800 claim.  He was dropped

About six years ago my ears clogged up with wax, probably as a

1. Inject olive oil into ears.
2. Prevent leakage of oil with cotton.

Cute anecdote, but hardly indicative of the population.  From the responses
I've received to that post (all from men, by the way) I get the impression
that unless a person is willing to drop down and masturbate whenever the
need or desire strikes, then that person is very hung up on sex.

With tv programs about ""boobs"" (Seinfeld) and ""masturbation (again Seinfeld)
and with condoms being handed out in high schools and with the teenage
pregnancy rate and the high abortion rate here in the States, I would
not assume that we American's are frightened of sex.  Rather we are a bit
stupid about it.  Healthy sexuality does not require flamboyance or
promiscuity.  It requires responsibility.

I would put it stronger than that.  I consider it nonsense.

Simply put, I do not see any way that a ""Platonic essence"" could have
any *real* existance.  ""Essence"" in the Platonic sense does not have
any referent as far as I can tell - it is just an imaginary concept
invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in
other ways.

So, to attribute an 'essence' to God is to attribute to him something that
does not exist!!  Thus the orthodox Platonic formulation seems to leave
the unity of God in limbo, since it is based on a non-existant 'essence',
thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address.

Thus, to me, the unity of God must be primary, and the triality must be
secondary, must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles, or to modes
of interaction), since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one.

I would also be interested in finding out about the '94 Talon,
and I suspect that many other people would be interested too,
so let's get some responses on the net.

The question again:
Does anyone have any info on the 1994 Eagle Talon / Mitsubishi
Eclipse / Plymouth Laser?

I know that the old Talon was based on the Mitsubishi Galant,
and that in Japan, a 240 hp twin-turbo V6 1994 Galant has been

Some years ago -- possibly as many as five -- there was a discussion on
numerology.  (That's where you assign numeric values to letters and then add
up the letters in words, in an effort to prove something or another.  I can
never make any sense of how it's supposed to work or what it's supposed to
prove.)

Somebody posted a long article about numerology in the Bible, saying
things like ""this proves the intricate planning of the Scriptures, else
these patterns would not appear"".

Then there was a brilliant followup, which was about numerology in all the
other numerology posts.  Stuff like ""The word `numerology' adds up to 28,
and the word appears 28 times in the posting!  Such elegant planning!
Further, the word `truth' ALSO adds up to 28; the writer is using these
numerological clues to show us that we reach truth via numerology!""
(These examples are made up by me just as examples.)

I really liked that reply, because it did such an excellent job of showing
that these patterns can be found in just about anything.  However, I did
not save a copy of it.  I do not remember the author.  I'm only 90% sure
that it was posted to this newsgroup.

BUT, on the off chance that somebody remembers it and saved it, or that the
author is reading here, I wanted to know if anyone could send me a copy.  (I
think it should be made into an FAQ, if we can find it.)

If a manual transmission is a ""must have"", then the M-B 300TE is not in
the running.  You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North
America.  It seems that buyers here (or, maybe more accurately, the
distributors) are not interested in manual trannies.

The '93 300 line comes with a 217 hp engine.  All earlier years are 177 hp.
I have an '87 300E, with a ""mere"" 177 hp and auto tranny, and I find that
it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation.  More is always
nice, but I can't complain.

I test drove a Saab 900 CSE last fall.  Here are my impressions:

1) Awesome power, especially over 3500rpm, when the turbo really comes on.
2) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front-wheel
   drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously ""hook"" into
   the corner.  Not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful
   front drive cars.  (The CSE is 200hp.  Mercedes is rear-drive, so it
   does not have this problem.)
3) Huge interior and cargo space.
4) The most ""rubbery"" shifter I have ever encountered.  I drove a 5spd.  It
   was absolutely numb.  You might be able to get used to it - I don't know.
   I also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right.
   From the shifter's position, I got the impression that Saab really designed
   the car for an automatic.
5) It was rather noisy:  Engine buzz, rattles, and creaks.  (Mercedes does
   not exhibit these characteristics.)

You should also check out the new BMW 525 ""touring"".  This is a wagon version
of the 525i.  It fits into the class with the 300TE and Saabs.

Nice explanation except that it isn't N-hydroxylation that causes the
formation of the N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), but rather a
direct two-electron oxidation. In addition, there is one school of thought
that contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of protein
is the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen.  

As far as drug toxicities go, acetaminophen has and continues to be one
of the most intensely scrutinized. An excellent recent review of the topic
can be found in: 

	Vermeulen, Bessems and Van de Straat. 	
	Molecular Aspects of Paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity and its
	Mechanism-Based Prevention. Drug Metabolism Reviews, 24(3) 367-
	407 (1992).

	(Acetaminophen is known as paracetamol in Europe)

I couldn't agree with you more about what an awful way to die a toxic
dose of acetaminophen causes.  I've heard a number of descriptions by
physicians associated with poison control centers, and they describe a
lingering very painful death.

The last time we discussed homosexuality, I asked whether anyone could
identify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the Bible
prohibited, but which might in some circumstances bring no apparent
harm to anyone. Put another way, the question is whether homosexual
intercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe
is immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight
being offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my
question in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting
response based on Roman Catholic theology).

However, I think now that I can at least answer my first question.
Link Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping
with one's aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society,
that is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage
(and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception.
The trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular
relationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to
how they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but
all the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can't
a man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is
dead and that he has ""married"" her? How does this case differ
from the *duty* to marry one's brother's childless wife.

Are these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous
marriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps
that God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable
of understanding why.

P.S. Please don't bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe,
as some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions.
You don't know whether I am homophobic or not. You don't
know me. To call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing the
person may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobic
remarks.

The above article is a good short summary of traditional Christian
teaching concerning the death of Mary.  
Also very good is ""Re: Question about the Virgin Mary"" by Micheal D.
Walker.  He tells the story very well.
I would like to add that in the Eastern Orthodox Church we celebrate ""The
Dormition (or falling asleep) of the Theotokos (the mother of God)"".  The
Icon for this day shows Mary lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles
who are weeping.  Christ, in his resurrected glory, is there holding what
seems to be a small child.  This is, in fact, Mary's soul already with
Christ in Heaven.  The Assumption of Mary is one more confirmation for us
as Christians that Christ did indeed conquer death.  It forshadows the
general resurrection on the last day.  The disciples were not surprised
to find Mary's body missing from the grave.  She was the Mother of the
Savior.  She was the first of all Christians.  She gave birth to the Word
of God.  If it were not for her we would not be saved.  This is why we
pray in the Orthodox Church, ""Through the prayers of the Theotokos,
Savior save us.""

There is no doubt that we have here two editions of the same
text; and as that of De Sacramentis is localised in Upper Italy
and dated about the year 400, it is the most ancient witness we
possess as to the principal parts of the Roman canon, which only
appear in the Sacramentaries some time after the seventh
century. The question as to whether the Roman canon is not older
even than that of De Sacramentis is discussed by
liturgiologists.  Mgr. Batiffol is of this opinion, but we, on
the contrary, think that the former bears traces of closer
composition, of a more carefully guarded orthodoxy, and that
consequently it is a text corrected from De Sacramentis. We
shall see, in studying the list of names in the Memento of the
living and that of the dead, that Mgr. Batiffol argues with good
reason that he can date these fragments from the pontificate of
Symmachus (498-514). We thus have the state of the Roman Mass,
or at least of the chief parts of the canon, at the beginning of
the fourth century.

Actually, IFF is a *format standard*.  It is not a picture file format, sound
file format, but there exist several formats that use the IFF standard.  The
IFF picture standard used by mostly everybody is a FORM ILBM (or just ILBM).
The only 3D IFF specification I know of is TDDD, which is used by Imagine and
it's predecessor, Turbo Silver.   It is possible that some of the other Amiga
packages use another *IFF* spec, but I don't know of any.  Lightwave will load
TDDD FORM's I believe.

That's fine.  These words have multiple meanings.

As a self-proclaimed atheist, I believe that *some* conceptions
of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact, and I lack
belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no
reason for me to believe in these.  I usually use the word
agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of
a god is unknown inherently unknowable.  Note that this is a
positive belief that is quite different from not believing in a
god; I do not believe in a god, but I also do not believe the
agnostic claim.

I have osteoarthritis, and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes
(type II, I guess--no insulin). 


I've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what really
surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known. 
Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for
arthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the very
conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the
weight gain. 

For myself, I'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentle
and sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in about
eight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off. 
Instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with much
interest, like bread on the waters.


With this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I can
suggest is to make it as gradual as possible.

Meanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just a
balanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which-
parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, and
which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty.

Is it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorly
understood?  Is it just that I'm used to pediatrician-talk (""It's strep;
give him this and he'll get well."") and so my expectations are too high?

I'd like to hear stories on experiences with the Hyundai Sonata.  I
know Consumer Reports has trashed them but the people I know that
have them swear by them.  They also haven't had the problems with
them that Consumer Reports claims.  I haven't driven one yet.  I
have driven a '93 Hyundai Elantra (which Consumer Reports also
trashed) and was very impressed with it.  The local Hyundai
dealership (""no-haggle"" policy) is offering an Elantra GLS w/ power
moonroof for $13163.  They also have a Sonata base, w/ Sunroof for
$13997.  I know my preference is for a Sonata GLS w/ sunroof and
4-spd automatic.  I'll decide which engine I prefer after test
driving both the 4-cyl and the V6.  The Sonata is also offering a
$1500 rebate.  Hmmm, that's another question.  Is the following
scenario the appropriate manner to handle ""negotiation""?

1.  make offer
2.  subtract rebate from offer

Subject: Tangent vectors of Kochanek-Bartels splines
Organization: University of Trondheim
Lines: 33

I'm working on a system which uses a given set of 3D key frame
positions (x,y,z) to control an imaginary camera movement.  I'm
using Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described in the SIGGRAPH '84
proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between
the key frames.  I want the inbetweens to be given in the form
(x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and
z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when
positioned at (x,y,z).

The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the
positions of the inbetween view points to be generated.  I've
tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the
chord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are
not key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the
viewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although
the spatial movement seems to work fine; and I'm quite certain
- I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementation
error...)

Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for
similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.
I'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at
  iharkest@lise.unit.no
Anyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of
the replies if they contact me.

That is the standard advice in dermatology texts.
The soak part greatly increases the inconvenience.  Don't bother unless

Exactly, but it adds to the ""ritual"" aspect, which is important for

Greasy no matter what. Vaseline (generically, petrolatum) is

Try USP lanolin, at least for maintenance (preventive) therapy.  USP
lanolin is natural and much less greasy AND cheap (don't buy the more
expensive perfumed lanolin mixture).  As I've commented before, petrolatum
is a poorly characterized mixture of hydrocarbons which are not found in
biological systems (that is not inherently bad, but smell it up close,
even on your hand), are partially absorbed into the body and remain there
for months or more, and have associations with cancer.  Don't panic, but
also don't believe it's God's gift to the human skin.

One of the responsibilities of a licensed physician is to read the medical 
literature to keep up with changes in medical practice.  All the clamor 
over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical 
trials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against 
cancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, 
treatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals 
are in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to 
use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due 
to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden 
Rubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize 
the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use 
and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to 
restore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is 
yet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care 
patients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just 
because he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that 
all physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be 
found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known 
for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a 
women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and 
not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida 
colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common 
than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.

The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by 
a candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is 
warrented.

Medicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There 
has always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is 
kidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been 
done to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the 
intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones 
from forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to 
breakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of 
Medicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, 
increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is 
restricting calcium intake.

The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to 
be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.
If it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans 
David?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider 
yogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as 
Gordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast 
infections should decline.

Well, since my wife is (in your gentle term) a ""bastard"", I can
probably speak with a bit of authority on this. Any ""stigma""
associated with children conceived and/or born out of wedlock rests
solely upon the parents--they've committed a sexual transgression for
which they should repent. The child itself has no a priori limitations
on him or her; indeed, the concept of blaming the child for the
parents' sins is one most Mormons would find appalling; note that LDS
theology rejects original sin, as the term is usually defined, and the
subsequent need for infant baptism (cf. Moroni 8 in the Book of
Mormon).  Indeed, LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases
holds parents responsible for their children's sins if they have
failed to bring them up properly (cf. D&C 68:25-28; note that this
passage applies it only to members of the LDS Church).

Also note that there is no ""big genealogical book in Salt Lake City"".
The LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains
containing (on microfilm) vital statistic records (birth, christening,
baptism, marriage, death) gathered from all over the entire world. I
may be misremembering, but I believe they have records for some 2
billion people in that vault. At the same time, the LDS Church is
building up an on-line genealogical database. In neither case is there
some kind of ""worthiness screening"" as to whether someone can be
entered in. The only potential issue is that of establishing who the
parents were, and that would apply only in the case of the database.

Well, I had had similar reactions many times.  That was when I really
started WATCHING CAREFULLY - reaction to Doritos - hey guess what's in
there - reaction to Lawry's season salt - guess what's in THERE

I'll give you a hint - I've had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY
different products with MSG that I figured out one thing.

UNLESS I plan on getting sick - I won't eat the stuff without my
Seldane.  And did I ever learn to read labels.

Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY
time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products.
And consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge)
- it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own
personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST
IMPORTANTLY it's enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof
that my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didn't flinch when I literally threw
out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg -
and he always flinches when there's waste - but it was a simple
explanation - I won't eat this stuff, I WON'T cook with this stuff, so
I can either throw it out or give it away.)

Probably Lawry's seasoning salt.  I LOVE the way that tastes.  

I'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.  I've noticed that I
have a certain tolerance level - like a (small) bag of bbq chips once
a month or so it not a problem - but that same bag of chips will
bother me if I also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of
the Chinese restaurants the day before.

But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG -
some say it's more like 20% - but let's say that it's 5%.  How many
people would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I
KNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test.
Like thanks guys but I don't WANT to get sick.  Also - I'm sure that
most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at
different times.  If I have a cold I'm MUCH more susceptible to the
reaction than when I'm healthy (as proven today - when I'm stuffy but
for some silly reason I still gave in and decided to have the BBQ
chips ;}).

Cathy doesn't - I haven't saved all my postings but I NEVER called it
""chinese restaurant syndrome"" and I NEVER stated I got it only from
Chinese food.  I just thought it would be easiest to conduct my
personal test at a Chinese take out place that I knew would hold (or
not hold) the MSG.  I can't call up whoever makes Doritos and ask them
to make me ONE back of chips without MSG.

Sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause
pregnancy, even in the presence of a hymen. I doubt that sperm could make 
it through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum,
but it might be possible.

So, it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant.
Also, some hymens are sufficiently loose to allow near-normal intercourse
without rupturing. The problem when investigating these phenomenae is,
of course, getting an honest account of what exactly happened.

The original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital
but I can answer a few general points.

Elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after
being in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment
will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even
young people find the change unsettling.

Though we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -
anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the
elderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the
change of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have
tried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the
patient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of
the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these
patients early.

Anaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)
generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to
the individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full
mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is
the sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult
tasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.

Haloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life
of the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow
release formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are
sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing
more it is hard to comment.

  In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little
programs. One is a C program that will perform a ""morph"" between
any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then
it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out
to a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions
and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would
let me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply
performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary
object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know
an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the
origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there 
must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because
I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new
point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However
this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is 
appreciated.

	My feeling on baptism is this:  parents baptize their baby so that the
	baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism (and thus removal of original
	sin) on its soul in the event of an unexpected death.
	
	That is, the parents speak on behalf of the child which is too young

	*always* do what they believe is the best for their baby?  Why would
	that apply to the baby's physical needs only but not his/her spiritual
	needs to have God's grace?
	
	The purpose of confirmation is for the baby (now young adult) to 
	decide to re-affirm for himself/herself the promises that his/her
	parents made at baptism.  That is where accepting Jesus into your
	heart comes in.  In baptism, the parents ask Jesus to come into their
	baby's heart; at confirmation the child repeats that request 
	independently.
	
	(By the way, these are my personal feelings, though I believe they are
	pretty close to what the doctrinal position of the Catholic Church on

Summary: Two important clarifications to previous post of mine ...


This is to followup my previous reply on this topic, which it has been
pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots.

1.  I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used 
    to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is 
    misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself.
    Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug
    therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute 
    it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this
    distinction becomes important.

2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible 
	diagnostic marker.  However, this might look like something
	people associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or
	unpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD.  
	One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual
	can and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although they
	are an unending source of anxiety.  
	The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with 
	OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer to
	a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part.

	Some references (one non-technical and several technical)
	that someone was kind enough to supply for me
	but was unable to post themself :

Why not write a NAPLPS decoder for your choice of platform and release the
code to the net? Then other willing souls can help port it to other platforms.
NAPLPS was designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the
same as X, but while X is intended for high-bandwidth network connections,
NAPLPS was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections.
>
>Is there a color version of MGR for Linux? 
>
>Does anyone have any other suggestions for a Linux based GUI BBS ?

I'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you
wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you
use SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way? Most people would say that
SLIP/PPP exist and are reasonably well designed protocols, so lets just
implement them. I see it the same way with NAPLPS. It is an existing, well
thought out, extensible protocol for online graphics, so why not implement
it.

If you need any advice on implementation, just e-mail me. I am currently
getting a beta version of my CorelDraw to NAPLPS converter working well
enough to release it by May 15. If you or someone else does not get going
on a freely available NAPLPS decoder, then I intend to do it after I get
a my conversion program out of beta, and get a couple of other things done.

just out of curiosity, how is this ""dog clutch"" any different from a synchro
transmission.  What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little
i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as ""dogs""
and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized
gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,
that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?

Actually in D&C 68:25-28 the parents are being held accountable for
their own sins.  Specifically they are accountable for their failure
to teach their children properly.  If I fail to teach my children
that stealing is wrong then I am responsible for their theft if they
later indulge in such behavior.

This is very similar to the instructions Ezekiel was given in
Eze 3:18.  If Ezekiel failed to do his duty and warn the wicked, 
not only would the wicked die in his sins but the Lord would hold
Ezekiel responsible!  Similarly parents are responsible to teach
their children right from wrong.  I suspect most Christians (and
Jews etc.) would agree that parents have this responsibility.

Sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg.  There is only one way for
pregnancy to occur: intercourse.  These days however there is also
artificial insemination and implantation techniques, but we're speaking of

  This neatly eliminates the need for a savior and ""proves"" that we can be
saved by works alone!  If we have no original sin, then it is possible for
us to save ourselves by not sinning.  I understand the reasoning behind your

provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can 
restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus 
constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need
for a reentrant graphics library.

Just a quick comment.  As a baptist clergyperson, I find the idea
of such a ""baptism"" (if the news report is in fact accurate, and
they seldom are regarding religion) offensive.  The pastor here seems
to have a most unbaptist view of baptism- one that seems to demand the
ceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent.

We do baptize converts, but no one who has been deceived into hearing
the word is likely to be a convert.  If in fact the grace of God might
work in such a situation, there is no harm done in waiting a day or
two.

Baptist believe in regenerate membership.  Did this church include these
half-baked (at best) converts into their church fellowship? Or do they
somehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose?

This kind of ""evangelism"" is certainly not baptist, and probably not

	The first and only thing I've ever tried to auto-trace was a piece
of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the
outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously
suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I
suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline
very irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines
(not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most
common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and
tangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of
the coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive
algorithm that would let you step in and say ""no, dummy, you're going the
wrong way"".

	Steve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his
doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii).
A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized
micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles.
This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with
its auto-trace tool.

	In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he
was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a
good centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future
analysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem

I worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several
Toshiba 1600's in a short space of time. They were all around 2 years old.
Some screens went completely (as above), others were just ""dodgy"".

This happened to about 5 or 6 out of, maybe 100. They were fairly reliable up
to then and I don't think it was a special problem with Tosh's (no link to the
company). So I would think that 21 months may not be unreasonable - just
unlucky!

I intend to endeavor to make the argument that homosexuality is an
immoral practice or lifestyle or whatever you call it.  I intend to
show that there is a basis for a rational declaration of this
statement.  I intend to also show that such a declaration can be 
made without there being a religious justification for morality,
in fact to show that such a standard can be made if one is an atheist.

Anyone who wants to join in on the fun in taking the other side,
i.e. that they can make the claim that homosexuality is not immoral,
or that, collaterally, it is a morally valid practice, is free to do
so.  I think there are a lot of people who don't believe one can have
a rational based morality without having a religion attached to it.

This should be fun to try and figure this out, and I want to try and
expose (no pun intended) my ideas and see other people's and see where
their ideas are standing.  As I'm not sure what groups would be interested
in this discussion, I will be posting an announcement of it to several,

I decided to start this dialog when I realized there was a much larger

To give the other side time to work up to a screaming anger, this will

But wouldn't that go for any sin.  My father told me when he was growing
up Catholics were not allowed to associate with anyone who was divorced.
There are a few verses prohibitting divorce.  Somehow, divorce became
acceptable (even in Catholicism anullments).  Certainly it is no longer
a sin to associate with a divorced person.  The point is that each person
has their own temptations to deal with.  Paul repeatedly talks about the
""thorn"" in his side, some think it refers to lust, others pride, but
who knows.  Whatever the thorn was, apparently it was not ""compatible""
with Christianity, yet does that make his epistles any less?  The Bible
warns us against judging, greed, anxiety, impure thoughts, bearing grudges,
etc., etc.  I suppose we should seek out all the so-called Christians
who have entertained impure thoughts and oust them.  All those who have
given in to greed, get 'em outta here.  Jesus pointed out that he
was the physician for the sinners.  Any attempts to make homosexuals
feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible
with Christianity.  Is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone
try to become closer to Jesus, we need to keep them away.  Does Jesus need
us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin.  Do we really mistrust 
Jesus when he says he can forgive any sin?

Think about it.  Among the people Jesus encountered were sinners and
the Pharisees.  The sinners he embraced and forgave.  The Pharisees,
hypocritcal, unmerciful, self-righteous, pointed out others sins and
did not seek and thus did not gain forgiveness of their own sins.  What
I take from this and other verses is that if we do not admit our sins,
those sins will not be forgiven.  And since those guilty of even one sin
are guilty of the whole law, those not repenting the judging of others
are guilty, as guilty as if they committed the same sin they judged others
of.

The poor in spirit, meek, humble, merciful, pure of heart, peacemakers, 
those who thirst for justice, those who suffer for His sake are blessed.

As a child i can remember picking up a centipede and getting a rather painful 
sting, but it quickly subsided. Much less painful compared to a bee sting. 
Centipedes have a poison claw (one of the front feet) to stun their prey, but
in my single experience it did not have a lot of ""bite"" to it.

I would think that simply being pregnant with the incarnation of the

   This is no less logical than the assumption that if something is
_not_ in the Bible, then it _must not_ be done.  But I don't really
think that's what he's saying anyway.  See below.

   What about the letter to Philemon?  In it Paul at least hints that a
certain slave be released.  Also, slavery in those times was not the
same as the type of slavery we had in the U.S.  I think a better
comparison would be to indentured servitude.  I don't really want to get
into a discussion on slavery.  Anyway, although it does demonstrate your
point, I don't think it is relevent, because the original poster did not
say that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not
immoral.

   Back to the original poster's assertion.  He is not in fact making
the logical error of which you accuse him.  He stated the fact that the
Bible does not say that babies cannot be baptized.  Also, we know that
the Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.
_Everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other Scripture to the
contrary, i.e. an exception.  Since there is no exception listed in the
Bible, we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the Bible means what
it says, that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.  And so we
baptize infants.

   To summarize, you accused the original poster of saying if something
is not forbidden by the Bible, then that proves it is OK; i.e. if
something cannot be disproven, it is true.  He rather seemed to be
asserting that since the Bible does not forbid, _you cannot prove_,
using the Bible, that it is _not_ OK.  There is a difference between
proving whether or not something can be proven or disproven (there are
theories on provability in the field of Logic, by the way) and actually
proving or disproving it.  The other logical error we must avoid falling
into is the converse: that if something cannot be proven, then it is
false.  This seems to be the error of many _sola scriptura_ believers.

   I think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use
Scripture alone to prove something either way about infant Baptism,
although the evidence seems to me to favor it.

Perhaps I should quit eating mushrooms, soya beans, and brie cheese
which all have MSG in them.  It occurs naturally.

I'm not going to quit eating something that I like just because
it *might* cause me trouble later or causes problems in *some*

what goes in my mouth and not spending every day reading conflicting

Fine.  I've made my decision and I don't think it's appropriate

the most obnoxious and harmful words, IMO, in the English (or

it is, so what?  Give people all the information but don't ram

>Ok, what's more important to gay Christians?  Sex, or Christianity?

I'm afraid I see that question as very tendentious.  Try rephrasing it:

	What's more important to Christians?  Love of God or love
	of other human beings?

to which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like
the other.  I am *deeply* suspicious of any ""flavor"" of Christianity
which would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a ""priority""
over the other such as to claim a conflict.  True, we are told to let
the dead bury the dead, to ""hate"" family rather than let it keep us from
following Christ.  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our
fellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us
to the presense of God.  It is particularly satanic to twist love of God
in such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different
level than the one who is so caught up in ""love"" of God.

The trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex.  Yes, it
has sometimes been the case that the Church has ""taught"" that all sex
was nasty, evil, sinful stuff.  But when man and wife leave their parental
homes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is the
vehicle of becoming ""one flesh"" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on what
is wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)).  Less provocatively, what I
mean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social
interaction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution of
marriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with and
foster the children they beget and support their children's mothers.
This is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus' citation of
that passage.)

	[ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as
	  I have just described; but another thing that characterizes
	  human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not
	  only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the
	  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are
	  in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of
	  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ]

Yes, of course it sometimes goes ""wrong"" -- like all else we do, it is
infected with sin, and you find married ""couples"" where there is no bond,
and people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond
formation (the ""infatuation"", ""falling in love"" phase) that they break
any forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep
unity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away.
Satan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love --
but in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with God's grace
under the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem
for Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devil
is watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.)

So, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHT
Christians?  Sex, or Christianity?  Paul, clearly, tended to think that
sex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitable
to him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the
hard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to
each other -- seemed somehow to undercut the ""proper"" preparation for an
immediate eschaton.  Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should
act *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our
mates that proposes a long lifetime together.  And telling people *not* to
bond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause
of the the commandment to love.  I would claim that only a very few saints
have the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication,
mind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual
life in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in
the type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship.  We
are human, and little good comes of trying to ""mortify the flesh"" to the
point of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings.

>Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex
>completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,

It depends entirely on context.  If that context is major hypocrisy
on the part of those who find us ""stumbling blocks"" I am much less of
a mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins.

There are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift,
and maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that
seems to them to lead only to sin.  Nothing I say should ever be read
as demeaning such a gift.  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our
conspecifics, and indeed for all God's creation, that can develop to
the full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded
in sex.  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance;
telling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?)
is fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our
spiritual endowments from God.  To one person is given the gift of
speaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yet
another prophecy; and to still another teaching.  The notion that some
*particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies.

""Hate the sin but love the sinner""...I've heard that quite a bit recently, 
often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality...
but the context really isn't that important. My question is whether that
statement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not.

Hate begets more hate, never love. Consider some sin. I'll leave it unnamed
since I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not 
something is a sin. Now lets apply our ""hate the sin..."" philosophy and see
what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the 
stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so 
strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate
the sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and 
do things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even 
believe what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner begins
to hate us (they certainly don't love us for our constant criticism of their
behavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainly
cannot be a good way to build love.

In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our 
neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he 
commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians
supposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one
way to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We
need to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love 
with theirs. Only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. The best way to
love someone is to pray for them.

Hello,

We are looking for a graphics package (preferably complete
with source code) that will run on our UNIX operating system
(a Sequent running DYNIX 3.2).  This graphics package must 
support a wide variety of character based graphics devices 
(PC's running a terminal emulator, primarily).  
At this point, X11 graphics is not an option.

This graphics program should, if possible, support these
sorts of graphics operations (minimum requirements):

   1) Complicated axes (log, linear, etc.) with fairly
      precise axis labels (multi-line labels, etc.)
      Major and minor tickmarks on axes, etc.	
  
   2) It would be nice if some limited amount of color
      plotting were available, if the output device
      supported it.

We have a copy of gnuplot and are currently using it, but
gnuplot has some limitations.  We are looking for something
more robust than gnuplot.

At this point, I'm looking for information about packages that
might solve our problems.  If you have any information, please
contact me at the above email address.  If the product you know
about is a commercial software package, please send a phone number
or email address so that I can contact them about pricing, etc.

It can doubtless be taken that Jael's slaying of Sisera was a type
of Mary's victory over sin. But even if we take Deborah's words as
applying prophetically or symbolically to Mary, they must still be
applicable literally to Jael.  We may well take them to mean that
God used her as a part of His plan for the deliverance of His
people, and that she has this in common with Mary.  But we have no
reason to suppose that they mean that she was sinless, and thus no
reason to take the like expression applied to Mary as proof that she
was sinless.

Our 20-month son has started falling sick quite often every since he
started going to day care.  He was at home for the first year and he did
not fall sick even once.  Now it seems like he has some sort of cold or
flu pretty much once a month.  Most of the time the cold leads to an ear
infection as well, with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics
3 weeks out of 4.  I know kids in day care fall sick more often, but we
are beginning to wonder how often ""more often"" really is, whether our
son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average, what the
longer-term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are,
and what we can do to build up his resistance.  He really enjoys his day
care and we think it's great too, but we are beginning to wonder whether
we should think about getting a nanny.

Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions?

-- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?
How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?  Is there any data on
home care vs. day care?

-- Does being sick ""build immunity"" (leading to less illness later),
does it make kids ""weaker"" (leading to more illness later), or does it
not have any long term effect?

-- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
term effects?

-- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
normal, and what does one do about it?

-- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?

Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much
appreciated.  Thanks a lot.

Yes.  A Pontiac Grand Am suffers a factor of _2_ increase in price

However, a Dodge vehicle (the one that Congressman Gephardt mentioned)

The Moderator of the General Assembly, the Rev. John Fife, visited our
church about a week ago (just 4 days after Rev. Spahr--it's been a busy
week for our small church!!).  He was asked specifically about the issue
of homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the GA meeting next
month.  Evidently, there are 15-20 known resolutions pending that range
the gamut from ""outlawing"" homosexuality altogether to ""legalizing"" it
completely.  He will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficult
issue that the church has had to deal with since the Presbyterian church
split in two over the issue of slavery more than 100 years ago.  Without
question, the issue may split the church again after we've been reunited
for all of a dozen years or so.  He is hopeful that it will not and is
pushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortion
issue last year as a solution.

He is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we, the
members of the church ""Agree to Disagree"" on the issue, admitting that
both sides have honestly studied the Scriptures and had the Spirit lead
them to different conclusions.  It worked last year when the abortion
issue threatened to do more or less the same thing, and he is hopeful that
the GA can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree
with their own view.

that long, it makes me sweatening.

Initially I called it ""palpitation (spelling?)"" until I later learnt that 
the terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beats.

So, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am I a stragne person?
I always believe I am unique. 

Thanks.

The words I have underlined are at the heart of the problem. A ""quick
look"" doesn't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Having
studied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one
stage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying
theological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point.
The clash between Jeremiah and the ""false prophets"" was primarily in
the theological realm. The ""false prophets"" understood their relatioship
to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is
possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,
which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David's
descendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part
of the Lord to keep a descendant of David's upon the throne and to never
allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a
Judahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly
been Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the
theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel
through Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant
after the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the
local prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic
covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah
spoke his prophesies. The ""judgement prophesies"" were deeply loaded with
theological meaning.

In my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson
""New York will burn"" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic
theological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.

Lines: 184

[continuing with Dr. DeYoung's article-]
 
               SURVEY OF NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI

D.S. Bailey

     D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning
of arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively
engage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi (""effeminate""), those who
engage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothing
of ""inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to
psychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual
practice as evidence of perversion"" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the term's
reference in Paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the
term as ""homosexuals.""  Bailey wants to distinguish between ""the homosexual
*condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*"" [italics in
source].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt's translation
""sodomites"" best represents Paul's meaning in Bailey's judgment (39).  Bailey
clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.

J. Boswell

     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is
that of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives
it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive
sense.

      In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites ""linguistic
evidence and common sense"" to support his conclusion that the word means ""male
sexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes.""  His argument is that the arseno-
part of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to
base sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male
sexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that most
interpret the composite term as active, meaning ""those who sleep with, make
their bed with, men.""  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the
historical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes
(""child learner""), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such
as paidoporos (""through which a child passes""), the paido- is neither subject
nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point is
that each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  More
directly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it
objectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective
(343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.

     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. 
These were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greek
arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passive
would be parakoitai (""one who lies beside""), Boswell affirms.  He claims that
arsenokoitai was the ""most explicit word available to Paul for a male
prostitute,"" since by Paul's time the Attic words pornos (""fornicator"") and
porneuon (""one committing fornication""), found also in the LXX, had been
adopted ""to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed
fornication.""*7

     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato,
Aristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus,
Boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that
arsenokoitai ""did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of
Paul"" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus
Empiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in ""all discussions
of homosexual relation"" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, including
the Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria,
Gregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for his
omission as ""final proof"" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 

     Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from
discussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited are
Tertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses
""circumlocutions.""  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius
Felix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By the
sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual
activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife
(353).

     Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes, 

   There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted
   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every
reason
   to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of
   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).

It is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male
prostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not
disapprove of ""gay inclination,""  ""gay relationships,""  ""enduring love between
persons of the same gender,"" or ""same-sex eroticism""  (112, 166-17).

In 1972, they lowered the engine compression so that it would run on
regular gas (not to mention the addition of emission controls).  The '72 
also added pop-out rear quarter windows...

I am becoming increasingly convinced that most of us take Paul's illustration
about one body / many parts far too narrowly. It is easy to say that the one
body represents a particular sect of Christianity (generally our own), and
the parts are clearly the various offices of ministry. There is a place for
that. But having met people who are walking closeely with God in a wide
variety of doctine - Catholic, Protestant, liberal, conservative, Orthodox,
etc. - I am willing to encompass a wide spectrum of views within the
context of the 'body of Christ.' And I am equally sure that one day, after
we shug off this mortal coil, when we no longer see through a glass darkly
but see clearly, face to face, we will all be ashamed at some of the things
we held as truth. We ought all fellowship, worship, and serve where we are
called, and understand that where we are called may not be where everyone
else is called.

One of the fathers of the reformation (help me out - can't recall the name)
put it quite succiently:

	In essentials, unity.
	In nonessentials, liberty.
	In all things, charity.

While I agree with Lewis (Mere Christianity) that calling oneself a Christian
implies some basic, fundamental standards of belief if the word is to mean
anything at all, I think most of us define the bounds of essentials a bit
too broadly, deny the place for liberty in questionable issues near those
bounds, and ignore the requirements of charity all together. 

Me? I attend a Vineyard church, speak in tongues, am effectively an
inerrantist, though I'll grant some inaccuracy in translation, am moderately
pre-mill, and evangelical. But, I'm not ready to damn those who use icons,
say mass in latin, uphold the Virgin Mary (though I really don't believe
that she was sinless), vote on Church membership, or insist on baptism for
salvation. Of course, I think my doctine is pretty close to the truth -
why would I follow it if I believed something else was closer to the truth?
But my understanding of the reality of a walk with Christ is continually
evolving as I spend more and more time walking with Him, studying His word,
and fellowshiping with others in the (often extended) family.

physically developed is because she was sexually abused as a younger
child. This, she went on to say, kicks the pituitary gland into
action and causes puberty.

Sure there are quacks. There are quacks who don't treat and quacks who
treat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly. 
There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones. 

There are people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theories
and rationals. There are ill-reasoned, absurd, theorists. 

Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who.  

Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors
quacks in Babylon. 

Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnesses
aren't, or can't, be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to argue
against the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a month
or so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an
opinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody. 

Sometimes a correct diagnosis
takes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes the
disease, they haven't developed something recognizable yet, or they have
something that no one is going to recognize, because it hasn't been
described yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears out,
sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment,
sometimes they find it's incurable.  

There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an 
illness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's is
more like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking.

There might be an IPAS routine that does that,but I can'r be sure.  Another
way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the
image.  Then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection.  It will

Thanks for posting the exact wording which I had not seen
previously. The part I quote above seems to me to indicate
disapproval of capital punishment - it is to be used only when
other means are not sufficient; I would say this is a stronger
restriction than saying that capital punishment is useable when
justifiable. I would certainly say there are cases where a
crime justifies death (perhaps this is the Old Testament
interpretation), but my reverence for life would say that I
would oppose the actual infliction of the death penalty (a New
Testament interpretation?). It is a matter for debate whether
the death penalty works to keep the peace in a way that
non-violent provisions do not. I don't believe it does, and I
would certainly observe that in the USA, where you have the
death penalty, there is a far higher murder rate than here in
the UK, where we do not.

""A note on gamma correction and images""

Author: Graeme W. Gill
        graeme@labtam.oz.au

Date: 93/5/16


""What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?""
--------------------------------------

Although it would be nice to think that ""an image is an image"",
there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of
different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole
lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit
complicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded
images from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image
viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some
look too light. ""Why is this ?"" you may ask. This, is gamma correction
(or the lack of it).

Why do we need gamma correction at all ?
--------------------------------------

Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode
ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you
have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer
image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of
the scene, then you have created a ""linear"" or un-gamma-corrected
image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate
the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding
and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).
Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage
and feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you
an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light
coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage
something like this:

Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma

So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image
will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to ""gamma correct""
the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT
will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get
what you want. So you have to do this to your image:

gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)

For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.

If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?
-----------------------------------------------------

The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.
Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras
or video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images
already have some gamma correction done to them, and you are 
rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images
with a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets
corrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those
images with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will
look vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is
not exactly right for you particular CRT.

Whose fault is all this ?
-----------------------

It is really three things. One is all those display programs
out there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another is
that most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or
don't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.
The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma
correction is all about, and create a lot of images with varying
gamma's.

At least two file formats do the right thing.
The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording
the gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)
specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a
linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).

Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)
allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you
are using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to
view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and
utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma
of an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction
yourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,
and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.

[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the
gamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the
appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity
in the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to
take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends
to give a tint to the image. ]

How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg
(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file
containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear
to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using
dithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects
images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point
at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half
way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if
you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a
bit.)

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have
a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness
will be above the center.

If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction
for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the
gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be
around 2.2 

[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the
-dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA
environment variable in your .profile]

How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?
-------------------------------------------------

This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of
true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of
1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma
correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images
(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected
to some degree or other.

If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will
look good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will
look too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.

Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing
-----------------------------------------------------

One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as
Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better
use of the storage medium. This is because the human
eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction
has a similar compression characteristic. This means images 
could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),
if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that
every time you want to do any image processing you should
convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain
the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and
none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard
gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected
images at the popular level.

If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,
and if image manipulation software takes care to use
extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,
then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.

(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a
standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the
highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).

Well I am one of those (apparently) odd people who can sometimes
control their dreams.  For example, I might decide before going to
sleep that I want to repeat a favourite dream, or dream about a
specific place.  Or if I am having an unpleasant dream, I can often
(not always) redirect events to something more pleasant.

I guess I think that the same standards apply in these ""directed""
dreams as apply in waking fantasies or real life (ref Jesus teaching
about looking at a woman lustfully being the same a committing
adultary).

When my normal dreams display themes that I would not conciously chose
to dream about, I take that as a sign that all is not well with my
""inner life"" - maybe I have underlying tenstions/fears that need to be
resolved, or maybe its straightforward sin.  In either case, the cause
needs to be resolved.  

In fact, either case is pretty rare.  I don't
often remember dreams that I don't chose to have.  When I do, they
almost always tell me something important.
I also almost never dream in pictures, and especially not in colour
(in fact I've had precisely one full colour picture dream that I can
remember, and it was definately spiritually important)
I tend to dream in sound, with the odd blurred image, in black and
white.

Interesting topic - I'll be fascinated to read other responses.

PS. Just to make it clear, I don't do ( and have never tried ) OOBEs.

First off, use some decent terms if ya don't mind.  This is sci.med, not
alt.sex.

Secondly, how absolutely bogus to assume that ""American's are just too hung
up on the penis....blah,blah"".  I think most American's don't care about
anything so comlicated as that.  They just think it ""looks nicer"".  Ask 
a few of them and see what response you get.  Others still opt for
circumcision due to religious traditions and beliefs.  Some think it is
easier to clean.  Still others do it because ""Daddy was"".

Dont' be so naive as to think American's are afraid of sexuality. 

My son is not circumcised, and I can vouch for the argument that it is
more difficult to keep clean than a circumcised kids'.  Not so much that
the foreskin is difficult to pull back (it isn't) but because my son

The kind of interpretation I see as ""incredibly perverse"" is that applied
to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual
behavior and rape.  Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context
should be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander
-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.

The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_
in this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of
activity that could be named by ""fornication"" or ""theft"" or ""coveting"" or
""reviling"" or ""drunkenness"" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may
or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very
fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at
all ""clear"" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest
in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,
with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated
Christian discussion of ALL these areas.

Homosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I
know) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and
child molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly
""harmless"" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --
that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter
you cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that
you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]

	""'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything
	is for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one
	will not let anything make free with me.""  [1 Cor. 6:12]

Which is a restatement that we must have no other ""god"" before God.  A
commandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some
people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.
It is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary
argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such
behavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.

I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.
Fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your
assumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of
laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of
which Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine
them.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are ""moral"" and
which ones are ""ritual.""  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology
course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories
in an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).
And I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus
from the ""ritual law"" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.

I'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this
matter) about how ""repulsive"" and ""unnatural"" our acts are -- and what
do they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of
arbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating
insects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you
say that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part
of the ritual law?

For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can
be ""law"" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)
it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to
determine why you ""pick"" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the
whole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: ""No doubt I am free to do anything.""
But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,
the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go
through Leviticus and decide each ""command"" there on that basis, then
your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this
context, it is remarkably offensive to say:

>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.

Well, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the
one that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously
(though one can always find jokers) in ""defense"" of bestiality.  It is
absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*
raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human
adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant
than the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you
are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the
world.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not
mine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in
our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing
us as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means
you can think of to do so.

Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,
the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to
love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-
ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get
in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.

Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every
corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same
old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never
even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with
the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can
manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great
emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even
taking the trouble to find out what it is.

Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.
WHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to
condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN
to BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?
God forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or
condemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in
insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are
SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.

Why, for God's sake?

	""For God did not send the Son into the world
	to condemn the world,
	but that the world might be saved through him.
	Whoever believes in him is not condemned,
	but whoever does not believe has already been condemned
	for refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.
	Now the judgment is this:
	the light has come into the world,
	but men have preferred darkness to light
	because their deeds were evil.
	For everyone who practices wickedness
	hates the light,
	and does not come near the light
	for fear his deeds will be exposed.
	But he who acts in truth
	comes into the light,
	so that it may be sh0own
	that his deeds are done in God.""	John 3:17-21

For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from
evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and
rejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do*
show a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits
have been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.

However, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity;
and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who
fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow
it with the darkness of false witness against us.

Any rocky mountain spotted fever experts out there ?

The doctor thinks a friend might have this.
The question is, doesn't the tick have to bite you ?

You frequently find a tick crawling on you after a walk
in the woods around here, but you tend to notice it before
it bites you; pulling one out of your skin is something
you're not likely to forget.

Can you get the fever without it biting you ?  Do they
sometimes bite you and then let go so you don't realize
you were bitten ?  I know they will let go once they've had
their fill, but you certainly would notice this (arggh).

So how do you get the fever if you never pulled a tick
off yourself (as opposed to finding one merely crawling
on you) ?

   The Catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in
any way.  Since God knows everything, He therefore knows everything that
is going to happen to us.  We have free will, and are able to change
what happens to us.  However, since God knows everything, He knows all
the choices we will make ""in advance"" (God is not subject to time).  Too
often arguments pit predestination against free will.  We believe in
both.

Oh, that's not so bad. Every time I try to change the oil, I forget to
shut off the engine first. The hot oil comes out and scalds me, blinds
me, then the engine starts to overheat, and while I'm screaming in agony
and trying to crawl out from under the car, I grab the red hot exhaust
pipe and get third degree burns on my hands. My screams intensify as I
finally emerge from under the car, and I struggle to my feet in front of
the car, whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super
heated coolant. Then the engine seizes, but not before the cylinder head
explodes, piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron.

This happens every time. I'm starting to think I should pay the mechanic
$25 instead paying the hospital $250,000 and the dealer $25,000 for a new
car. This gets costly when you change the oil every 3000 miles.

apparent.  The better approach is to buff minor scratches completely
off with a cleaner/mild abrasive.

Yes.  Here's what you should do.

Keep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay,
but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into
the array of the vertices that comprise them.  You set a flag for each
vertex when you transform it, so you don't have to transform any vertex
more than once; you also do backface elimination before processing the
polygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don't have
to be transformed at all.

Whenever you transform a vertex, check if it's on the far side of the hither
plane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result.

Then do your Z clip; any vertices that get produced will have to have their
projection done at that stage.

We know that sermon.  It is posted roughly every month or so by different
persons, and that doesn't make it any better.

How did you get the idea that skeptics are closed-minded?  Why don't you
consider the possibility that they came to their conclusions by the
proper methods?  Besides, one can come to a conclusion without closing
one's mind to other possibilities.

I you don't agree with a person, please ask him why he thinks like that,
instead of insulting him.  Perhaps he's right.  Follow your own advice,
be open-minded.

If you don't post a bit of evidence for your claims, I'll complain that
it's always those ""neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever"" types who 
narrow-mindedly judge others without knowing their motives.

I don't have any written data but I know what I have experienced.  I use  
S-50 in everything including my lawnmowers.  In my car it smoothed the idle
and reduced the operating temp by 5 degrees.  I havent used it long enough 
to test for wear, but some people I know have.   
 A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors
at least every other year if not every year.  Since he has been using S-50
he has went 5 years without an overhaul.

Also a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200K
miles on them because the coustomer thought it was time.  These coustomers
had ran S-50 since almost new.  It was found when measuring the internals
of the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be
expected of 30K miles not 200K.

In my opinion it works.

Well, I dived in feet first and reverse engineered the .PRJ file as much
as I needed to - extracted the mapping icon information - which is
when it dawned on me that 3D Studio is useless for my needs. I need
a mapping icon per applied texture.  I want to use a special purpose
graphics computer for rendering the 3DS models and it requires a texture
rule/plane to be specified in 3Space, i.e. position/orientation of the
mapping rule.  Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS to apply
textures to ALL objects/faces, it renders (no pun intended) 3DS totally
unsuitable for my needs.

Anyone got a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for a
PC?  I must be able to specify texture rules (one per texture) and this
must be saved in a file which I can read.  I haven't found any info on Alias
in the copy of the faq that I have.

I forgot exactly what her age was but I remember clearly
that she was born in a family of poverty and she did not
have any education, whatsoever, at the age of the apparitions.
She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were
living in an abandoned prison cell of some sort.

She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about 
what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.  
For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since 
Bernadette did not receive any.  One time, after several apparitions
passed, The Lady finally said, ""I am the Immaculate Conception"".
So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and
over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the
priest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, the
priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, ""Do you know what
you are talking about?"".  Bernadette did not know what exactly
it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for
the priest.  The priest continued with, ""How did you remember
this if you do not know?"".  Bernadette answered honestly that
she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her
way to the priest...

The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then.
But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which
the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic
personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette.

(Note: This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which
our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her
bare hands in front of pilgrims.  At the start little
water flowed but after several years there is more water 
flowing.)

And presumably this is a matter of degree; it must be common to prescribe

Yes I have written something that creates meshed fractal terrain
surfaces for exactly the purpose you require, importing into 3D
modelling packages. Be warned, the data content is high and brings
many packages to their knees. We use it primarily for MicroStation
but it exports DXF, as well as other formats, so you should be OK.
You can get it from my FTP mirror site in the US.
It is
   wuarchive.wustl.edu
my stuff is located in the
   mirrors/architec
directory. Please FTP the README file first.

Yup.  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between
the plates, and taking a Kirlian photograph of it.  You then cut off part of
the leaf, put the top plate back on, and take another Kirlian photograph.  You
see pretty much the same image in both cases.  Turns out the effect isn't
nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between
photographs.  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place
conducts electricity.  Surprise, surprise!

Money probably has a lot to do with keeping the practice of routine 
circumcision alive... It's another opporitunity to charge a few hundred
extra bucks for a completely unnecessary procedure, the rationale for 
which until recently has been accepted without question by most
parents of newborns.  

One could also imagine that complications arising from circumcision
(infections, sloppy jobs, etc) are far more common than the remote chance
of penile cancer it is purported to prevent.

Well, an LT1 Blazer wouldn't come close to a GMC Typhoon in speed, I think its
too heavy.  As it is right now, the normal 210HP 5.7 engine has plenty of 
power for a full size Blazer.  Of course, I'm not saying GM shouldn't put the
LT1 in it :).  It seems like they have a real winner with that engine.  Why
spend so much more money into getting a 32 valve DOHC V8 when you can take 
an LT1?  It even seems to get pretty good gas MPG (for a 5.7, that is.)


[talking about Impala SS]
>Will this be in the 4-door Caprice body?  I'm just curious if Chevy is

Yeah, it's a flat black, lowered 4 door Caprice riding on 17"" aluminum rims and
Eagle GS-C tires.  The rest of the car is basically a Caprice LTZ (read: 
plush police package) with 300 horsepower.

I heard that Chevy is resurrecting the Monte Carlo but that's going to get 
their 3.4 DOHC V6 and not the LT1.

Fractal Landscape Generators
----------------------------

Public Domain:

  Many people have written fractal landscape generators. for example
  for the Mac some of these generators were written by
  pdbourke@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (Paul D. Bourke).
  Many of the programs are available from the FTP sites and mail
  archive servers. Check with Archie.

  Vista Pro 3 has been ported to the PCs.


CIA World Map II
----------------
[  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.
  If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the
  Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from
  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with
  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]

  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)
  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries
  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360
  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for
  every half degree longitude and latitude.
 
  A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine
  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).
  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and
  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as
  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask
  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.
  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.
  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to
  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.

NCAR data
---------
  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of
  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at
  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.
  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending
  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,
  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive
  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,
  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.

UNC data tapes with voxel data
--------------
  There are 2 ""public domain"" tapes with data for the comparison and
  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT
  scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.
  (softlab@cs.unc.edu)

  The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from
  omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD

NASA
----
  Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data
  from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,
  etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following
  address for more info:

     National Space Science Date Center
     Goddard Space Flight Center
     Greenbelt, Maryland 20771
     Telephone: (301) 286-6695
     Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov

  The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
  Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log
  in as 'NODIS' (no password).

  You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
  no parity, one stop). At the ""Enter Number:"" prompt, enter MD and
  carriage return. When the system responds ""Call Complete,"" enter a few
  more carriage returns to get the ""Username:"" and log in as 'NODIS' (no
  password).

  NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of
  what's there is available at present.

Earth Sciences Data
-------------------

  There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including
  imagery. This listing is called ""Earth Sciences Resources on Internet"",
  and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]
  in the directory COGS under the name ""internet.resources.earth.sci""

  Some sites include:
  aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images
  ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from
        Magellan and Viking missions etc.
        pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole
        archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an
        e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter
        to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the
        subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:

        send SPACE Index
        send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91

        (Capitalization is important! Only text files are handled by the
        email server at present)

13. Background imagery/textures/datafiles
=========================================

 First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP
list above.

24-bit scanning:
----------------
  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for
  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :
  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll
  house supplies.
  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have
  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.

Books with textures:
--------------------
  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.
  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also
  a wide variety of stock art is available.
  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,
  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.

  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books
  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your
  graphics work. Their address is:
	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,
	00196 Rome Italy,
	Piazzale Flaminio, 19
	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60

Texture Libraries:
------------------
a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit
   textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit
   TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume
   (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

14. Introduction to rendering algorithms
========================================

a. Ray-Tracing:
---------------

  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read
  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would
  suggest:
   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press
     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4
  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong
  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines
  (erich@eye.com)

There's a more concise reference also:

  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"", in
  ""Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD"", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,
  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.

It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.

b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)
--------------------------

A good reference is:

        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,
        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.

15. Where can I find the geometric data for the:
================================================

a. Teapot ?
-----------

""Displays on Display"" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole
story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has
the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe
model of the teapot.

IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column ""Jim Blinn's Corner"" describes
an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for
example are used.

The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get
them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at
a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).
The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
tessellation at any specified resolution.

b. Space Shuttle ?
------------------

Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle
datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):

model1:
A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)

406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)
389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).
Payload doors non-existent.
Units: unknown.

Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He
said there is no proprietary information associated with it.

model2:
The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in

gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo
hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data

model3:
The triangles' model.

This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.

Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did
not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.

model4:
The NASA model.

The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,
defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:

<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>

From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

3473 vertices.
2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,
 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,
 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).
Payload doors closed.
Units: inches.

Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model
Proprietary info: unknown

model5:
The old shuttle model.

The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.

104 vertices.
452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).
Payload doors open.
Units: meters.

We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for
some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor
Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.

========================================================================

16. Image annotation software
=============================

a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in
  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored
  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
  rasterfile.

b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some
  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not
  sure exactly what they are.
  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.

c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)
  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats
  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.
  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu
  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)

d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).
  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all
  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.

e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output
  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.

f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based
  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host
  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and
  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based
  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,
  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed
  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation
  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).
  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for
  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.

  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not
  be redistributed without permission.

  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that
  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging
  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.

g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the 
  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 
  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many
  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as
  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest
  X11 archive.

WIT
---
  In a nutshell it's a package of the same genre as AVS,Explorer,etc.
  It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system (IMHO)
  Major elements are:

  - a visual programming language, which automatically exploits the inherent
        parallelism
  - a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program

  Iconified libraries present a rich set of point, filter, io, transform,
  morphological, segmentation, and measurement operations.
  A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,
  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.

  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming
  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware
  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their
  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers
  (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports
  Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

IDL/SIPS
--------
  ""A lot of people are using IDL with a package called SIPS. This was
  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working
  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL
  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I
  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general
  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.
  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose
  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I
  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh
  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've
  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best
  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large
  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a
  freebie if you want it""

  ""My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,
  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its
  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It
  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing
  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even
  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH
  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which
  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use
  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical
  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,
  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image
  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity
  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve
  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) ""

 understand, you can get packaged programs from Research Systems, though

SCRY
----
[ From the README : ]

      Scry is a distributed image handling system  that  pro-
 vides image transport and compression on local and wide area
 networks, image viewing on workstations, recording on  video
 equipment,  and  storage on disk.  The system can be distri-
 buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-
 tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video
 animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to
 produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from
 visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,
 and  image  processing  operations.   Both  the  clients and
 servers run on a variety of systems that provide UNIX-like C
 run-time environments, and 4BSD sockets.

SVLIB / FVS
-----------
  SVLIB is an X-Windows widget set based on the OSF (Open Software 
  Foundation) Motif widget set. SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets 
  comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, 
  menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability 
  of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an 
  encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap 
  manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted
  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only 
  color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets 
  developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget 
  set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers 
  using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other 
  Motif widgets.

  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
  simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these
  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these
  data graphically.

GVLware Distribution:
        Bob  - An interactive volume renderer for the SGI
        Raz  - A disk based movie player for the SGI
        Icol - Motif color editor
---------------------------------------------------------

The Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC) has been
developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2D and 3D
data sets.  In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using
these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the
Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies.
A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
package called ""GVLware"".

GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available
via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive
volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to
an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.  Icol
is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz.  Source and
pre-built binaries for IRIX 4.0.5 are included.

To acquire GVLware, anonymous ftp to:
        machine - ftp.arc.umn.edu
        file    - /pub/gvl.tar.Z

To use GVLware:
        mkdir gvl ; cd gvl
        zcat gvl.tar.Z | tar xvf -
        more README

Some Bob features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Renders 64 cubed data set in 0.1 to 1.0 seconds on a VGX
        Alpha Compositing and Maximum Value rendering, in perspective
            (only Maximum Value rendering on Personal Iris)
        Data must be a ""Brick of Bytes"", on a regularly spaced grid
        Animation, subvolumes, subsampling, stereo

Some Raz features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Loads files to a raw disk partition, then streams to screen
            (requires an empty disk partition to be set aside)
        Script interface available for movie sequences
        Can stream from memory, like NCSA XImage
        
Some Icol features:
        Motif interface
        Easy to create interpolated color maps between key points
        RGB, HSV and YUV color spaces, multiple file formats
        Communicates changes automatically to Bob and Raz
        Has been tested on SGI, Sun, DEC and Cray systems

BTW:    Bob  == Brick of Bytes
        Icol == Interpolated Color
        Raz  == ? (just a name)

19. GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)
===================================================

GRASS
-----
  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army
  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and
  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a
  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,
  although it is reported to have significant image processing
  capabilities.

  Feature Descriptions

  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the
  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source
  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass
  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using
  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who
  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very
  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software."" A first review  of
  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in
  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the
  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric
  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective
  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus
  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them
  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68

  Host Configuration Requirements

  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh
  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC
  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,
  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster
  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it
  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented
  in raster (grid-cell) form.

  Availability

  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:
  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).

  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to
  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.

  This location will be the new ""canonical"" source for GRASS software, as
  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.
  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and
  ""tar"" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John
  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,
  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review
  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently
  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be
  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu

Microstation Imager
-------------------
  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS
  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager
  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a
  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.

  Feature Description

  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.
  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a
  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).
  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.
  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering
  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,
  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages
  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band
  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.

  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle
  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available
  for GIS applications.
  Host Configuration Requirements

  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)
  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software
  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.

PCI
---
  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes
  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of
  remote sensing data in eight or ten different ""industry standard""
  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I
  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix
  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly
  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.

  The ""PCI software"" consists of several classes/groups/packages of
  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common ""PCI
  database"" disk file.  The ""Tape I/O"" package is a set of utility
  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape
  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the ""PCI database"" file;
  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can
  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several
  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap
  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type
  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically
  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and
  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.
  ""multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5""), and
  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't
  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your
  particular application/interest calls for.

  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight ""parameters,"" read from
  a common ""parameter file"" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your ""default
  directory.""  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same
  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting
  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a
  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to
  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,
  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also
  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's
  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI
  data structures (database file, parameter file).

  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but
  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the
  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle
  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a
  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the
  Macintosh calls ""raw"") data from tape, in a number of different
  ""interleave"" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
  graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried)
  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start
  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI ""database"" file is designed to
  contain not only ""raster"" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map
  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of
  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often
  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,
  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this
  can go into the PCI ""database"").

  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX
  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific
  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to
  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would
  display directly from a PCI ""database"" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus
  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be ""overkill""
  in your case; it seems designed for the very ""high end""
  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice
  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's
  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which
  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe
  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these
  areas.

SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)
--------------------------------
  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis
  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed
  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels
  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since
  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging
  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.

  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and
  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).
  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.

  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may
  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame
  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X
  for display.

Antihistamines have been the active ingredient of OTC sleep aids for
decades.  Go to any drugstore and look at the packages of such sleep
aids as Sominex, Nytol, etc.  The active ingredient is:
diphenhydramine, the same antihistamine that's in Benadryl.

A question for any high-mileage Audi owners out there: I am
interested in buying a 1989 Audi 5000S for $5500 Cdn.  The
reason the car is selling for so little is that is has
155000 km on it (just under 100000 mi.).  The car's owner
claims the car is in good condition.  My question is: how
reliable are Audi 5000s with mileage that high?  Would it
be worthwhile for me to buy the car?  Any problem areas that
I should look out for?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Post responses and/or

        Check out the shocks where they mount, at both ends. if you have
    the type that have a loop?,from lack of a better term, and a bolt like
   piece sticking through, there should be a rubber bushing between the loop

  since the foundation of the world; but now once at
  the consummation He has been manifested to put away 
  sin by the sacrifice of Himself.

  27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die
  once, and after this comes judgement;

  28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear
  the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to
  bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him.


The first point is that this verse is part of an even larger
context, the subject of which is not the destiny of the
individual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christ's
sacrifice, ""once"", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen 
mankind.  Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his 
""Christianity and Reincarnation"".  The thrust of the passage
in its context is to liken the one time incarnation and 
sacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual 
experience of the human being after death.  The ""once"" 
is repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity 
of Christ's deed.  One thing for certain it does is to 
refute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than 
once.  But the comparison to the human experience - die 
once, then judgement (note: not ""the judgement"", but just 
""judgement"".  The word for judgement is ""krisis"".

Hebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense
of the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this
point, I would just emphasize again that the  passages 
that (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably
they are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial
of reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of
Hebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context,
namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after
death.

What should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially
silent about the fate of the individual human being between death
and the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly
be interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And
there are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc-
tion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.

We can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that
might have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them.
But what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach
to the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist
and ""new age"" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular
incarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ
as the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for
his deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences;
the redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of
the body, and the Last Judgement.

Taken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely
different perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their
sins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to 
works, the meaning of ""deathbed conversion"", the meaning of the
sacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all
those questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that
the discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion
one that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and 
Redeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such 
as the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian
doctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.

There are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible 
does not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ
also indicated that there were other things that we would come to know
in the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) 
could not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in
knowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole
of humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth
in the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify
all spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel
of the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the
greater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes, 
not the end of man's sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and
the New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.

David Hammerslag asked:

	How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage
	with Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will
	neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?

Several explanations for this seeming contradiction have been proposed,
but most LDS scholars whose opinions I have studied take more or less
one of the following three positions:

(1) Jesus was talking to a group of people (Sadducees) who were trying
    to trip Him up with what they felt was a silly hypothetical situa-
    tion that ridiculed the concept of a resurrection (something they
    didn't believe in).  These people -- and those associated with them
    (""Now there were with us seven brethren"", Matt. 22:25) -- would not
    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,
    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-
    ties; but that doesn't mean other, more faithful people could not
    have this blessing.

(2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of
    =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter
    activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in
    the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of
    before then.

(3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is
    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note
    that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in
    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with
    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-
    ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question
    was not significantly revised in the ""Joseph Smith Translation"" or
    ""Inspired Version"" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work
    was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-
    stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.

I get the feeling that we are debating at cross-purposes--that we
do not see the same fundamental assumptions, and this perhaps makes
my answers orthogonal to your questions.  I will try again.

Perhaps you believe that nothing exists aside from objectively
observable and provable things.  In that case, I cannot show you
that there is such thing as a spirit or a spiritual need--these 
things do not exist in the realm of the objective, but in the
realm of the subjective.

>
(By a.a., I assume you mean Alcoholics Anonymous, and not alt.atheism ;)
I would not say that AA ""handles"" spiritual needs.  Rather I would say
that AA (and other 12-step programs) help people come to terms with their
needs--ie that AA is facilitating the recovery, and that as part of the
recovery, they recognize their spiritual needs, and begin to rely on a ""higher
power"" (12-step's term) to fill them instead of whatever substance abuse
they had been accustomed to.  (Sorry, there is no objective proof here
either--no way to take 2 identical alcoholics and try to have one recover
by fulfilling spiritual needs, and one without and externally compare the
difference--we are talking about the virtually infinite complexity of
*people* here.)

>But I should say, if God is a necessary component
>of your ""spiritual needs"" then I truely do not understand at

>fulfilled by God, but can be ""masked"" in other ways (drugs etc).
>If this is the case, then you can leave out God: just describe
>the problem, not the solution.
>
Spiritual needs could be defined as things that people need in addition to
physical requirements like air, food, sleep, etc.  These are things like
the need for love and acceptance, and the need for meaning in life.  If 
one denies the existence of spiritual things, one would presumably call 
these ""emotional needs"". The reason Christians call them spiritual needs 
is that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual 
means--ie a person could be loved and accepted by many people, and do 
many meaningful things, but still have a need for love, which can only be
satisfied by the love of God.  Now the problem is that there are people who
accept the existence of these needs, and people who reject them.  Since I
believe in absolute truth, some of these people are right, and the others
are wrong.  So here are the 2 possibilities:

1) If Christians are right, then we all have spiritual needs--ie
we all need God.  Those who do not realize that they need God are 
deluded--they just haven't recognized it yet.

2) If Christians are wrong, spiritual needs are an artefact of our brain
chemicals.  Well-adjusted and properly-integrated personalities do not
have such things.  Christians are simply using the concept of God and 
spiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies.

I hate to belabour the point, but the existence of spirits and spiritual
needs cannot be objectively demonstrated or proven, just like the existence
of God cannot.  And yes, this means that there is a risk that all my subjective
evidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals.  But on the other hand, I 
could venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything that
I appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals.

I suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence and
demonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs, but my assertion
is that such things are not objectively demonstrable.  As I have said before, 
I myself am on the Christian side of agnosticism, having been pushed off the 
fence by subjective evidence.  (And no, I was not raised a Christian, so it 
is not a case of simply accepting what I was indoctrinated with.)

The Catholic church has an entirely different view of Mary than do 
""most"" other Christian churches (those with parallel beliefs
notwithstanding).  Christ, by most accounts, is the only sinless
person to ever live.  I too, have trouble with a sinless Mary
concept just. 
As for the related issue of the ""original"" sin - only Adam and
Eve will answer for that one.  My children do not answer for my sins,
certainly I only answer for mine.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
List of questions in the Gopher FAQ:

Q0:  What is Gopher?
Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?
Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?
Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins for Gopher?

Q7: What is veronica?
Q8: What is Available for Biology?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q0:  What is Gopher?

A0:  The Internet Gopher client/server provides a distributed
     information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide
     information system (CWIS) can readily be constructed.   While
     providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  Gopher
     facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers
     throughout the world. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?

A1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  Look in the directory
     /pub/gopher

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?

A2:  You will need a gopher ""client"" program that runs on your local PC
     or workstation

     There are clients for the following systems.  The directory
     following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous
     ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory
     /pub/gopher.

      Unix Curses & Emacs   :  /pub/gopher/Unix/gopher1.12.tar.Z
      Xwindows (athena)     :  /pub/gopher/Unix/xgopher1.2.tar.Z
      Xwindows (Motif)      :  /pub/gopher/Unix/moog

      MVS/XA                :  /pub/gopher/mvs/

     Many other clients and servers have been developed by others, the
     following is an attempt at a comprehensive list.  

      A Microsoft Windows Winsock client ""The Gopher Book""
        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip

      A Macintosh Application, ""MacGopher"".
        ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/Macintosh *

      Another Macintosh application, ""GopherApp"".
        ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp *

      A port of the UNIX curses client for DOS with PC/TCP
        oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe

      A port of the UNIX curses client for PC-NFS
     	 bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe

      A beta version of the PC Gopher client for Novell's LAN Workplace
      for DOS
         lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher

      A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX
         job.acs.ohio-state.edu:XGOPHER_CLIENT.SHARE


     * Note: these Macintosh clients require MacTCP.

     Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client
     itself.  Put the following on a gopher server:

       Type=1
       Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu
       Port=70
       Path=
       Name=Gopher Software Distribution.

 
     Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and
     look in the gopher directory.


     There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.
     The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine
     ""consultant.micro.umn.edu"" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more
     information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client
     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A
     client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,
     scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to
     in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?

A3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize
     network lag.

     Telnet Public Logins:

     Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area
     ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------

     gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan


     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of
     logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the
     custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)
     and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features
     of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file
     to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp
     sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.



---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?

A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University
     of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help
     our campus find answers to their computer questions.  

     It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information
     System used by a large number of sites in the world.

     Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to
     count. 

     The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached
     via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:
   
      Internet Gopher Developers
      100 Union St. SE #190
      Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA

     Or via FAX at:
 
      +1 (612) 625-6817

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?

A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.
     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to: 
     
       - Search local WAIS indices.
       - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher
         clients.
       - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher
         clients.
       - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using
         built in gopher querying or using native http querying.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?

A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :

Q7: What is veronica?

A7: veronica:  Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to 
     Computerized Archives.

     veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles
     in the entire gopher web.  As archie is to ftp archives, veronica 
     is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher
     items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.
     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy
     to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the
     gopher protocol.

     To try veronica, select it from the ""Other Gophers"" menu on 
     Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:

     Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace) 
     Type=1 
     Port=70 
     Path=1/veronica 
     Host=futique.scs.unr.edu

I've had a Valentine for about 9 months now and I agree that it is the best det

ust"" the Valentine more than any other detector I've owend. If the Valentine sa
ys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me, then it's mo
re than likely to be a speed trap. With my other detectors, I've gotten so many
 falses that I've begun to ignore someo of the warnings because I didn't want t
o drive like I had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal.

That directional indicator really, really helps. Plus, more info is almost alwa
ys better than less info. No matter how smart radar detectors get, the human br
ain is usually smarter. So, if I'm going to make a decisio based on information
 at hand, I want all the info I can get. Plus, if you divide the overall streng
th of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported, you'll find that each
bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat. With other detectors, yo
u'll just get one strong warning. My logic may be faulty on this, but I think i
t works okay.

Although, I must admit that I haven't really noticed the reflection problem of
one radar souce.

The millipede's around here (Austin) have no sting.  Some of the
centipedes do.  The question Rebecca Snyder asks is much like
asking ""How venomous are snakes?""  One either wants to ask ""which
snake?"" or point to some reference on the many different species
of snake.  Similarly, there are many different species of
millipede and centipede.  (These are different families;
millipedes have two pairs of legs per body segment, while

I agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way
it was.  My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the
possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in
1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book
because 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written
from a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always kept
an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the ""yeast
connection"".

But, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the right
clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In
the meantime, I'd still encourage people who have ""incurable"" chronic sinus
problems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to
administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with
liver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  It
is an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENT
says ""sorry, you'll just have to live with it"", it is time to step out and
try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence
(Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  At
this stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole and
have the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive
clinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with
relatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.  I'm glad I did this, since I
saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Of
course, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not
work for you.  Talk to your doctor.

You might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual
drops instead of shots for treatment. (You are given a small bottle of
antigens; 3 drops are placed under the tongue for 5 minutes.) My
allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way. Throughout the treatment
process I had to return to the doctor's office every month for re-testing
and a new bottle of antigens. After the allergy was completely neutralized
a bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about 4 months (the sublingual
drops are then taken 3 times per week), and costs $20. So the cost is
less than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home.

Why should it?  Placebos are effective under certain circumstances.  That's
why they're used.  

Actually, I don't know know anyone who has actually gotten a ""sugar pill"".
I don't know how it could be done, since prescription drugs are always
labeled, and it's easy enough to find out what's in a pill if you have the
name.

It's more common to prescribe a drug which is effective for something, just
not for what you have.  Antibiotics for viral infections are the most
common such placebo.

I'm not sure what you mean by this.  What do you think you're paying for?
You're not entitled to a prescription drug just because you pay for a
doctor's appointment.

I have noticed that newspapers don't even know what a fundamentalist is;
at the least, they confuse new evangelicals and fundamentalists.  In this
news group, the liberals don't even know what a fundamentalist is (crying
out ""legalist"" at anyone who believes and obeys God's Word). A fundamentalist
would train their children in the way God proscribes, not in the way that
man proscribes.  This would not include life threatening beatings but would
include corporal punishment. 

To the liberals, I cry out infidel at anyone who does not believe God's Word.

Signature follows:
""Your statutes are wonderful: therefore I obey them.""  Psalm 119:129
=========================================================================
David L. Hanson
Any opinions expressed are my own!

[As most people here know, I believe fundamentalist is sufficiently
ill-defined that I advise using some more specific term.  I think many
people use it to cover people who believe in inerrancy and a number of
related concepts (e.g. denial of evolution).  While the original
fundamentals movement was somewhat more specific, I would think most
people who accept inerrancy would actually support the whole original
agenda.  (It included a list of key traditional doctrines, e.g.  the
virgin birth.)  The term is now being used by the press to describe
aggressive conservative religions in general, most typically those who
are attempting to legislate religion.

Legalism is yet another ill-defined term.  However there is some
reason for its use in this context.  In fact the common theological
definition is the believe that salvation is through the Law.  I hope
no one here believes that our conservative contributors hold this
view.  However there is a basic difference in approach over what we
expect to get out of the Bible.  The conservative approach expects to
find specific behavioral rules.  Generally the posters advocating this
approach talk about the relevant passages from Paul's letter as God's
Law.  The liberal approach expects to find general principles, but it
regards specific behavioral rules subject to change depending upon the
culture and other things.  It's easy to see why a liberal would regard
the conservative approach as legalism.  It's hard to know quite what
other term to use.  The issue in this case is not inerrancy, because
no one is saying that Paul made a factual error.  Rather, the question
is whether his statements are to be taken as Law.  Calling the
positive answer legalism seems obvious enough terminology.  I haven't
seen any good alternative.

	and stuff like that there can increase the resale price of the car, you
	may want to head on over to the local library or borrow your friends
	Blue Book and read up on that sort of stuff.  I paid ~$400 under BB
	(retail) for my '87 Civic in 1990, and it was in perfect condition and
	had only ~14.5K miles on it.  The guy was desparate to sell, new kid on
	the way, etc., but it was a good price.  Remeber, both you and the 
	buyer, if he has any sort of brains at all, are using the Blue Book, so
	you should pick a fair price.

Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy
of cancer?  I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has an
oncologist.

A bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven a
dose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track the
distribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually given
intravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant will
insert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein. 

After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the
body, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high 
concentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking for
areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it.

As far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required
to start the IV line.

What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may
have resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if your mother
has had cancer, since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the
skeletal system.

I hope I have answered some of your questions.  Feel free to e-mail me if
you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related
to your mother's care.  I'm a newly graduated nurse, and I enjoy sharing
information with other people to help them understand things that they did
not know about before.

My thoughts are with you both.

In the kind I have made I used a Lite sour cream instead of yogurt.  May not
be as good for you, but I prefer the taste.  A few small bits of cuke in
addition to the grated cuke may also finish the sauce off nicely.

i am 99.99% sure that subaru (and porsche) use the boxer configuration
and not the inline 4 crank that you analyzed and compared. would you
care to re-evaluate the other case of a flat four?  i think that this
configuration is perfectly balanced as far as primary, secondary
forces and couples are concerned.  i have an article in front of me
that says so.

the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4, so even if it is mounted
longitudinally it will not take up lots of length.. and a longitudinal
placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain.

i think that subaru's ads hold water.  in practice, their flat fours
are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free,
though some may not like its peculiar note.  but as alfa has shown, a
boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of
recent hondas can approach.

You are absolutely right. After reading it over again, I realized that I
misunderstood what he said. My apologies. As for the question about
slavery, I have to disagree. Slavery in those times was the same as slavery
in the US. Some may have been indentured servants, but not all. I would also
expect Paul to do a little more than just HINT about a particular slave.

Either A: God exists, or B: He doesn't.  We have two choices, either
1: Believe in God, or 2: Don't believe in God.  If A is true, then 2
brings eternal damnation, whereas 1 brings eternal life.  If B is
true, then 1 has minor inconvenience compared with 2.  Thus, it is
rational to believe in God.

This has numerous flaws, covered in the FAQ for alt.atheism, amongst

Disillusionment strikes me as an excellent reason for stopping

About two years ago I posted the following:
 
I am planning to write a new book called ""Great Canadian Scientists.""
Please forward your nominations to me: shell@cs.sfu.ca
 
The rules are that the person must be a Canadian citizen. They don't have
to be born in Canada or even live in Canada, but they must have (or have
had, if they are dead) Canadian citizenship while they are/were great
Canadian scientists.
 
About 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the
end of this posting.
 
I'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness, and there may be a
gray area here. If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness, I would be
pleased to hear them. In any event, please nominate people even if you are
not sure they are great. I would like as big a list as possible.
 
Please give me a name and email address, phone number or mail address, so
that I can contact the person. If you don't know any of the above, then
give me their last known whereabouts. Also please give your reason for why
you think the person should be considered a great Canadian scientist.
 
After I have the list, I will choose about six of the most interesting ones
and do in-depth biographies of those individuals in the style of Tracy
Kidder's ""Soul of a New Machine"" or some other dramatic technique.
The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with 
one paragraph biographies.
 
If you have any other ideas about this project, I am interested to hear
them.

The list is growing nicely. It's amazing to see just how much was discovered
by Canadians. Actually there are many more who were born in Canada, but
became Americans after graduate school.
 
Please note: a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but I
feel he was really a Scottish/American with a summer home in Canada. Now
I know this is debatable, but please don't nominate him again.
 
If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list, please drop
me a line.
==================================================
 
That was two years ago. Since then, I have received a grant from Science
Culture Canada, a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the
book. Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book
for kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about
40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic
boxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo of
the scientist, Personal statement from the scientist, Narrative of a few
moments in the life of the scientist, ""What I was doing when I was 12"",
So you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, Experiment you can do. There 
will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph
biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing
will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added
richness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may
also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in
Canada as well.
 
I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close 
to being it. Hope to find one soon. 
 
I would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in the
pure sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of 
the list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed.
 
I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian
Scientists, and to discuss what is ""great"" what is ""Canadian"" and what is
""scientist"".

I am not sure that I am supposed to post this mail here. However
during the last year, while I was involved in developing graphical user
interface (GUI) applications, I have enjoyed being personally part of this
news group wherin I got some interesting information which helped me in my
work. I am posting my resuming hoping that people working in my area would
make time to look at it.

Dear Prospective Employer:

I am seeking employment as a software engineer with interests in software
design and development, in which I can utilize my experience in hardware, 
C & C++ programming, graphical user interface (GUI), operating systems and
computer networking.

I received my Bachelors of Engineering (BE) degree in Electronics
Engineering in 1990 and a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in Dec 1992 
from Iowa State University. Currently I am enrolled in a M.S. in Computer
Engineering at Iowa State University.

During my Masters program, as a research assistant since Jan 1991, I have
published three papers including one in the IEEE Transactions on Magnetics.
These papers are a reflection of the quality of my research and my ability
to learn new concepts quickly.

I have been involved in many projects involving software developments and
have extensive experience programming in C, C++, Fortran and Assembly Level. 
I am also familiar with operating systems like Unix, Ultrix and MS-DOS.
I am familiar with Motif/X programming and currently, as a research assistant,
am involved in graphical user interface (GUI) design using the multiplatform 
GUI toolkit XVT++. My experiences also include areas such as operating systems
and computer networks, through course work and projects. I was involved in the
study of the design and development of the internals of the XINU operating
system. I have also been involved in many TCP/IP programming projects in
computer networking.

While in college I learnt the importance of clear and concise communication.
I have also learned a lot about time management. In my M.S. program I
have maintained a 3.70 grade average, worked 20 hours per week and
have enjoyed being involved in many other extra curricular activities.

My software experiences along with my hardware background (Electronics
Engineering) would be very helpful in my career goals as a software engineer.
I request that my qualifications may kindly be reviewed. I would like to
have an interview to discuss your employment needs and my career goals. 
I am eager to hear from you soon.


Sincerely

S.N. Rajesh (rajsnr@iastate.edu)

 Include small amounts of hot, spicy foods with your meals. It's
 not a cure, but many people find it helpful to create extra mucus.
 You may also consider taking a few drops of iodine in juice or water 
 (consult your doctor first!), which is available OTC in Canada.
 If you have a sedentary lifestyle, exercising sometimes helps.

 I tried to e-mail you, but our board is having internet problems,
 so I'm not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not.
 
 Rutin is NOT a herb, but part of the bioflavonoid complex. You should
 generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid 
 complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that)
 you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other
 major component of the bioflavonoid complex.
 I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it
 showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-
 fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in 
 hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids 
 to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.
 Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so
 there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole
 bioflavonoid complex instead.

 I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that 
 they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose 
 bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...
 One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day
 for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.
  
 They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can
 be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are
 made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.

 About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, 
 with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.
 For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.
 
 In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they
 are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine 
 bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite
 small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times
 higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark
 extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.
 The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.'
  
   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:
 
   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable
   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing 
   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable 

   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing
 
   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!

Organization: University of Minnesota

What is the basis of the idea of hell being a place of eternal
suffering?  If it is Biblical, please reference.

Here's my train of thought: If God is using the Earth to manufacture
heavenly beings, then it is logical that there would be a certain
yield, and a certain amount of waste.  The yield goes to Heaven, and
the waste is burned (destroyed) in Hell.  Why is it necessary to
punish the waste, rather than just destroy it?

Hi I'm new to imaging, and my advisor and I would like to 
do some 3D reconstructions.

We take slides (biological), and image them on a 486.  Then
the software allows us to trace the outline of the objects 
we want to save.  The outlines are stored as a TIFF file.

We would like to convert a group of these outlines into a 
3D image.  We are unsure as to where to begin.  Someone mentioned
that if we could convert the TIFF into a vector format then 
we could view them in Autocad.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Yes, I have both Arts & Letters and CorelDraw.  I personally like
Arts & Letters better but there are things I like about Arts & Letters
that CorelDraw doesn't do an vice-versa.  I haven't found the perfect

My favorite feature from CorelDraw is that it imports alot of different

available with Arts & Letters.  However, I do find looking them up
in a book and referencing them by number to be annoying.

One of my major problems is that there isn't any programs available on
the market for the artistically deprived :-).

Nasopharyngeal cancer is (roughly, don't have references at hand) 20-30

The Chinese and others have done major studies.  Some association with

----------------------------

This posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and
Christians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the
question each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize
the postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes
arguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people
asking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most
common -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is ""how can a
Christian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about
it?""

First, on the definition of 'homosexual'.  Many groups believe that
there is a homosexual ""orientation"", i.e. a sexual attraction to
members of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual
sexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by
most groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the
term 'homosexual' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.
This is generally not accepted outside the most 'liberal' groups.  In
this paper I'm going to use 'homosexual' as meaning a person engaging
in sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven't heard of any
Biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who
remains celebate.

I think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be
homosexual.  This is often called a 'homosexual orientation'.  It is
not known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence
suggesting each.  The best evidence I've seen is that homosexuality is
not a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of
them is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help
people move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is
Exodus International"".  The reports I've seen (and I haven't read the
detailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the
Presbyterian Church's infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that
these programs have very low success rates, and that there are
questions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly
are people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as
important as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong
believe it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact
that it's hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant
than the fact that it's hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If
it's wrong, it's wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.
If it's very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more
willing to forgive it.

One more general background issue: It's common to quote a figure that
10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where
this came from.  Here's his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source
of the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by
orientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely
heterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,
one-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of
orgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have
most of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The
percentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey
Institute, based on data in the early seventies but not published
until the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can't
put my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online
information for Kinsey's own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog
at Rutgers:

This figure is widely used in all scholarly discussions and has even
been found to hold true in several other cultures, as noted in the
recent NEWSWEEK coverstory ""Is this child gay?"" (Feb. 24, 1992).  A
journalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting
her book that allegedly refutes Kinsey's study, but the scholarly
world seems to take her for a kook......

I've seen some objections to the Kinsey's study, but not in enough
detail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another
view, I'd be willing to include it.)

Most Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.
Not all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan
Community Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to
accept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows
it, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal
Church seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that
have congregational government, you'll find a few congregations that
accept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably
only one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches
permit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is
another issue.  I don't have any doubt that there are homosexual
pastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.

As to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here's an
attempt to summarize the issues:

The most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of
homosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:
""Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality"", U Chicago Press,
1980.

The argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws
in the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on
homosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some
passages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.
the sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was
homosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.
(There's even some question whether it was homosexual, since the
entities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying
because it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in
that culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot
offered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to
allow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance
for references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you'll see that few
seem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There's a Jewish
interpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any
rate, there's no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.

I do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set
of laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT
justification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.

The NT references are all in Paul's letters.  A number of the
references from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly
vague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not
mean homosexual.  Here's what he says: The two Greek words that appear
in the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and
/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words
actually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety
of metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests
""wanton"" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous
interpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was
that in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has
vanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less
frowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the
Catholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He
translates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none
of the church fathers understood the term as referring to
homosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the
early Latin translations, would be ""active mode homosexual male
prostitute"", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.

For a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee's commentary on I
Cor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.
However Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not
necessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated
with some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee
say taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very
definite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it
isn't a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against
Boswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a
translation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it
is that the word is almost never used.  Paul's writing is the first
occurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of ""male"" and
""f**k"" unfortunately doesn't quite tell us the meaning, since it
doesn't tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the
action.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.
In theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It's dangerous to base
meaning purely on etymology, or you'll conclude that ""goodbye"" is a
religious expression because it's based on ""God by with ye"".  However
since Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on ""homosexual male
prostitute"", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this
translation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something
which Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in
their translation).

In my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans
1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something
that happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result
of their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue
that this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false
gods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become
heterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in
fact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is
what Paul meant.

However I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law
against homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom
1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it's homosexuality that
appeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.
Despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I'm sure Paul
does not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.
Given his description of their situation, I rather assume that their
heterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do
believe that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.
But in all fairness, the ""shameless"" nature of their acts is a
reflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a
specific feature of homosexuality.

My overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have
enough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of
homosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are
not unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do
not seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of
homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the
other hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the
subject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality
in passing.

The result of this situation is that people interpret these passages
in light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look
to Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising
that they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT
prohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,
it is not surprising that they regard Paul's negative view of
homosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing
without any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As
readers of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these
approaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the
mouth when they see the opposing view described.  There's not a lot I
can do as moderator about such a situation.

A number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of
detailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact
I'm not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their
own beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the
question of whether Paul's judgement should apply to modern
homosexuality.

One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds
of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality
only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was
wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act
""straight"" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying
to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian
ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the
relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul's
judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make
judgements on these questions.

Another is the following: In Paul's time homosexuality was associated
with a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It
was part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often
occured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I'm
not in a position to say that it always did, but there are some
reasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active
and passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult
to act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active
mode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His
customers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This
supports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two
free adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.
Clearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,
slaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible
partners.  (However Fee's commentary on I Cor cites some examples from
ancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve
free adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations
in this paragraph shouldn't be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have
been discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there
surely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not
involve slaves or children.)

Some people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against
homosexuality.  I'd like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by
promiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a
homosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is
not at risk for AIDS.

Note that there is good reason from Paul's general approach to doubt
that he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,
apart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his
use of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual
marriage as what God ordained.

However the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning
against being too quick to deal with this issue legally.

I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is
not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul's
tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating
holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues
to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to
avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.
For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat
meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about
which they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously
would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)
remain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly
would rather see them married than in a state where they might be
tempted to fornication.

I believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the
views Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is
not what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still
conclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the
creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This
doesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The
question is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful
or whether you believe that it's a misfortune that is in a broad sense
due to human sinfulness.  If you're willing to consider the latter
approach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more
damage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.
The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often
fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from
psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when
attempts at living as a heterosexual fail.

This is going to depend upon one's assessment of the inherent nature
of homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you
may be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.
Clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency
to steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these
conditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are
intrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for
homosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are
actually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes
AIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual
relationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent
to Christian heterosexual relationships.)

In the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we've
heard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in
this situation.  I've also seen summaries of various research and the
results of various efforts for ""conversion"".  (Aside from the
Presbyterian report mentioned above, there's an FAQ that summarizes
our readers' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that
long-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a
par with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to
depend upon such a change is clear: When ""conversion"" doesn't happen,
which is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling
excluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement
of life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different
context) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I
think the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that
judgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay
sex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe
homosexuality isn't God's original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul
preferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian
relationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis
suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think such
relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love
with each other.

There's an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this
discussion.  The issue is that of ""cultural relativism"".  That is,
when Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an
eternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations
in the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist
on taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes
subjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as
relative?

When looking at this issue, it's worth noting that no one completely
rejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of
judgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians
consider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as
clear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:

  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in
	the OT -- it's not in the NT, but I mention it here because
	until relatively recently the Church did consider it binding
	on Christians)
  - prohibition against swearing oaths
  - endorsement of slavery as an institution
  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner

We do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the
argument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:

  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific
	agrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,
	but not to our market economy.
  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the
	same characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was
	concerned about
  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people
	how to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as
	an institution
  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to
	Roman tax farming

The point I'm trying to make is that before applying Biblical
prohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th
Cent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their
relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul
would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of
argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.
Until fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and
many Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,
slavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship
between God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants
or slaves of God.)

I am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally
relative.  Rather, I'm trying to say that *some* things are, and
therefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in
the Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the
action we're talking about now has the same moral implications as the
one that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue
that there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against
homosexuality are still binding, I'm willing to listen.  Those who
claim that the question doesn't need to be looked at are kidding
themselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey
all the rules listed above).

One thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue
creates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --
some laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is
really idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose
words are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among
Christians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to
people that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.
This is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as
strongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments
as conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I
can't help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way
of justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a
dangerous situation for Christians.

On the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I
have with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.
One of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically
determined.  I.e. ""God made me homosexual"", and I have no choice.  I
think ""God made me homosexual"" is a fine view for people who already
believe on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I
don't see it as an argument for acceptability.

Many people think that alcholism is largely biological, and drug
addiction may turn out to be as well.  That doesn't mean it's OK.
Most of us have particular things we tend to do wrong.  Some people
get angry easily.  Others tend to be arrogant.  Others tend to be
attraced to women who are married to someone else.  Homosexuality (if
we view it as wrong) wouldn't be different than any of these other
things.  If we are going to follow God, we all end up at one time or
another having to work to overcome bad habits and particular
temptations that cause us problems.  None of us can sit back and say
that because God made us the way we are we can just relax.  As Jesus
said, we all have to take up our cross daily.  This concept of dying
to self (which also appears throughout Paul's letters) seems to
suggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we
are called on not to accept.  Paul's letters and the experience of
Christians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us, and
the battle against it is lifelong and difficult.  The fact that
homosexuality is difficult to fight doesn't necessarily say it's OK.
Maybe this isn't the place where we have to die to self.  But I'd like
to make sure that those who think it isn't are fighting the battle
somewhere else, and not rejecting the concept that all Christians have
to fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin.

Bo Reike in the Anchor Bible volume on _James, Peter, and Jude_ points
out that all the examples given in this section of Jude are distinguishing
the elect from _apostates_, not just the wicked in general.  Hence, those
who were delivered from Egypt, but did not follow Moses (and, by extension,
God); the apostate angels; and Sodom and Gomorrah.  Quoting Reike:

	""Fornication may here, as often in the New Testament,

	denotes human society and its violent attempts at self-
	exaltation.  Sodom and Gommorrah represent the leaders
	of apostasy, and the surrounding cities correspond to
	their followers."" [p. 199]


There is no inherent reason to read this verse (7) as literally referring
to actual sexual lust for ""alien flesh"".  Nor is it inherently necessary
to understand it as referring to homosexuality, outside of the circular
reasoning that has already concluded that the sin of Sodom is the sin
of homosexuality.  The only place that the sin of Sodom is specified, and
not merely inferred, is in Ezekiel 16:49 ""This was the guilt of your sister
Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease,
bit did not aid the poor and needy.  They were haughty, and did abominable
things before me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.

For the same reason (overliteralizing the text) your correspondent's
suggestion that the reason the passage doesn't deal with homosexuality
is because the guests were angels and not men is just silly.  There 
are much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the

You need to use your shoulder muscles to push the mower. If you haven't been
doing much exercise, as I suppose you haven't, then a constant 20 minute
long effort can cause stiffness and cramps.

I just got back from the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting,
where the consensus was that sumatriptan (Imitrex) has no advantages
over DHE-45 nasal spray, which is much less expensive, has fewer side
effects, is as effective, and works more quickly (5-10 minutes vs. 30).
Besides, who wants to give themselves a shot (sumatriptan) when a nasal
spray works?  DHE nasal spray is not widely available yet -- it has to
be mail ordered from one of a few pharmacies in the country -- but most
neurologists now know about it and know how to order it.

Hi Javier, (how are things at Corp, my old stomping ground was c-level?)
Vibration when applying the brakes can be caused, on disc brakes at least,
by warped rotors. When the brakes are applied, there results uneven pressure
on the rotor.  Turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem
as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning (i.e. within spec).
There could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop
should be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free.

It would help if you mentioned chapter and verse from SIRACH and
from JAMES.

Job 5:13 (""He taketh the wise in their craftiness"") seems to be
quoted in 1 Corinthians 3:19.

James 5:11 (""You have heard of the patience of Job""), while not a
quote, implies that James and his listeners are familiar with a
story of a man named Job who exhibited exemplary patience. It is
possible that the story they know is not that found in the Hebrew
Bible, but rather another similar and related story. (One has the
same problem with direct quotes.)

Again, Matthew 1:5 (""Boaz begat Obed of Ruth"") tells us that Matthew
knew a story about a woman named Ruth who married a man called Boaz
and  became the ancestor of David. Since Ruth is not mentioned in
the OT outside the Book of Ruth, it seems likely that Matthew was
familiar with the book and respected it, and thought Ruth important
enough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy.

References like this do not prove that the NT writer considered his
OT source inspired or inerrant or canonical. But neither do direct
quotes.

----------


[1]  What is JPEG?

JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") is a standardized image compression mechanism.
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either
full-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes.
It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line
drawings.

JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it
handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG
respectively.

JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are
invisible to the eye.

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small
files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image
archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.


[2]  Why use JPEG?

There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store
24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a
2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the
size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even
with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using
JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply.

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel
(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have
only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as
black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed
in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.


[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?

JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,
GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.

As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or
gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and
similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display
hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,
such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels
that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.
(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they
should be avoided in JPEG files.)

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels
adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.
If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.

Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.
The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).

Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.
You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale
images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images
of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.

If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.
(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only
applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from
a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG
can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not
convert well.


[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?

Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three
files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section 6B.

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits
			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)
ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.
			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.
ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)

ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)
			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.
ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.
ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50
			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look
			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.
ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25
			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent
			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).
			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this.
ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)
			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:
			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the
GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical
ratio for real-world scenes.


[5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of the
information"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;
it's not a percentage of anything.

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.

The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for
experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to
go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.
The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).

If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are
prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".

(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other
JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different
quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just
""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)


[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.
If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"".
(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the
same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can
get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with
""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTP
List FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in
the news.answers archive.

NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.


[6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:

The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one
kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.

X Windows:

XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other
image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image
manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),
file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support
for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new
and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding
edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that
version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get
only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works
fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a
glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the ""save at normal size"" checkbox
when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,
also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The
ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped
displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software.

Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple
image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,
file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.
(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4
decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next
xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from
export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.


MS-DOS:

This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.
The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca
(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is
not flashy, but it's functional.

Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The
current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU
and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and
OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit
on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).
You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a
bit tricky; read the directions carefully!

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is
also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---
more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than
screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both
are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.
Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip
or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in
VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing.)

A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around
the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.
The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.

The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest
revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:
it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is
poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*
of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you
have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to
find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right
thing with hi-color displays.)

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20
and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or
jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.

Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in
particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format
files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version
2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.
NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is
not readable on non-PC platforms.

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI
formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.
A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs
is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20

refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means
""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA
mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files
in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you can
retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in
comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.

Microsoft Windows:

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.
(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,
due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)

The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0
is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.
Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...

JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG
files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's
an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.
(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,
including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)

WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;
it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.
It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and
slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror
sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow
286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,
which is roughly 25% faster.)

ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising
contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the
current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file
pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)

DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen
mode, not in a window.

OS/2:

The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).
Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip
    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.
/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip
    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip
    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.
    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip
    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows
    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip
    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,
    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has
    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.

Macintosh:

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of
the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.
To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running
System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install
the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.
(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0
in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is
not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for
details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.

The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big
improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu
(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and
QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people
like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out.

GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and
PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest
version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)
Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.

JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is
available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.
This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this
program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and
GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie
from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.
Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an
unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called
PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash
it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but
it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on
older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't
use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.

If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),
GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not
all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version
2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG
plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.

Amiga:

(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good
choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a
general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read
several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version
is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.

Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,
and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even
capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The
current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror
sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under
AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)

Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,
available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.

If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24
and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and
ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),
from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another
well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file
AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many
based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without
so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"",
""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,
anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space
it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.

Atari ST:

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.
These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.

For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level
grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.

I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for
Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.

Acorn Archimedes:

!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.

Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by
registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,
The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).

There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write
functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,
Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.

NeXT:

ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format
conversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.
ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at
sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are
currently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific
sub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that
does not support JPEG.


Portable software for almost any system:

If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.
If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a
display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM 24-bit image files.

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every
day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,
purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.


[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:

Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,
documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.
The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9
or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release
is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to
retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.
If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may
prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on
CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.
If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest
comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.
(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ
article ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)

The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and image
files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.
The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have
tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.

We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to
contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.


[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?

Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.
Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is something
of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck with
the standard usage though.)

Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most
images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings).

Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display
on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for
*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what
comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared""
into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image
source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.

(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see
posted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster
(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.
JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)

On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its
palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.
This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's
quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.
Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization
algorithm, you're out of luck.

For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in
this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent.

It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA
display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's
also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!

Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display
hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already
obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.
Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machine-independent fashion.


[8]  How does JPEG work?

The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine
transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more
than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.
This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files
/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in
using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.


[9]  What about lossless JPEG?

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the
final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG
algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.

Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say
""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.

At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees
bit-for-bit accuracy.

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a
Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.


[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?

Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;
it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations.

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of
official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's.

The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined
two JPEG-based file formats:
  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports
    pixels and not much else.
  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is
    a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation.
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards.

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the
TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well
defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common
denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped
inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are
available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor
that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand; see section 11 for details.

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and
Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This
applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF
format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format
files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)


[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:

1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,
    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.

2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a
    ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---
    it's worth a try, anyway.

3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they
    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.

4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off
    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.

5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are
    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),
    try stripping off everything before that.

In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	""begin"" line
	M_]C_X ...

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	""begin"" line
	M:'-I ...

If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading non-JFIF files.


[12]  What about arithmetic coding?

The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output
of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.
The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the
file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)

Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.
Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses
from these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best.)

At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future.  Stay tuned for further details.


[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?

It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could
decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered
image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around.

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an
identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current
free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation
output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)
One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.

In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original
quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.
(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.
If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but
that's a mighty limited capability!)

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format
(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot
of compression/decompression time this way :-).


[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?

As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original
full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from
that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality.

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to
make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;
that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in
section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)

Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through
JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,
not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color
border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows
system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this.)

cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but
for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher
Q setting may not be necessary.)

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.
If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The
trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency
color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).
To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression.
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image
than you'd get without smoothing.

With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing
capability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs.
Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed
dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular
fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong
smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing
wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol...

The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the
image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.

The clutch on my '92 Honda Civic EX-V (EX in the U.S.) does this too.
It's annoying.  Now that I think about, it _is_ worse when the humidity is

Subject: ReSound hearing aid theory as I understand it
Organization: University of Oregon
Lines: 41
Distribution: world
NNTP-Posting-Host: rhaller.cc.uoregon.edu

The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in
Hearing Instruments. I would appreciate any comments about this and other
'new' technology for hearing aids.

The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and
appears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that
a new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and
programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of
the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help
out in 'noisy' situations.

The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the
spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),
apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in
the low frequencies, while the important consonant information
(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are
treated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have
also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call
'abnormal growth of loudness'.

This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I
think the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you
exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit
becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach
the 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means
that if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high
end for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively
less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.
You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially
differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially
for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls
off a cliff).

Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low
and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency
information because of high volume of low frequency components.
Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech
and in simulated restaurant noise situations.

Note that ""scientific evidence"" in this area does not prove any conclusions.
There has been evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexual's
brains are different from heterosexuals- but that proves very little.

Also notice that the apostles did not have with them the ""scientific
evidence"" linking certain genes with alcoholism, or stealing with certain
genetic problems.  Even if they did have scientific evidence, I doubt it
would have stopped them from communicating the teaching from the Holy 
Spirit that these things are sinful.

This reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine.  He said 
something very true.  Christianity teaches that we should not give in
to our every inclination.  Most people do give in to their leanings.
In Christianity, we have the concept of struggling with the flesh,
and bringing it into submission.  One person may have a problem with
his temper, and having a murderous heart, another may have a problem
with homosexuality, another may be inclined to greed.  But God offers
us the opportunity to be more than conquerers.

The preying mantis bites the head off of her mate after she mates
with him.  Is it natural for a woman to do the same thing to her husband?
The Bible is concerned with human morality, and only touches on animal

also check out the episcopal church -- although by no means all
episcopalians are sympathetic to homosexual men and women, there
certainly is a fairly large percentage (in my experience) who are.  i
am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and

important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament

evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly _inherent_

-- or to a great extent -- homosexuals cannot choose how to feel about
other people -- which is why reports of ""curing"" homosexuals always
chill me and make me feel ill.  please not that, although i can't cite
sources where you can find this information, there is homosexual
behavior recorded among monkeys and other animals, which is in itself
suggestive that it is inherent rather than learned, or at least that
the word ""unnatural"" shouldn't really apply....

please remember that whatever you believe, gays and lesbians shoul not
be excluded from your love and acceptance.  christ loved us all, and
we ALL sin.  and he himself never said anything against homosexuals --
rather it is paul (who also came out with such wonderful wisdom as
""women shouldn't speak in church"" and ""women should keep their heads
covered in church"" -- not exact quotations as i don't have my bible
handy) who says these things.  i have a tendency to take some of the
things paul says with a grain of salt....

well, that's all i'll say for now.

It is one thing to be open-minded about phenomona that have not
be demonstrated to be false, and quite another to ""believe"" in
something like Krilian photography, where *all* the claimed effects
have be demonstrated to be artifacts.  There is no longer any reason

   News Advisory:

   Results of the largest heart attack study ever undertaken,
the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded
Coronary Arteries trial (GUSTO), will be presented Friday, April
30, at the Clinical Research Meeting.
   A press conference will be held at 12:30 p.m.
   GUSTO evaluates the most aggressive emergency-room treatment
strategies available to clear blocked heart arteries and restore
blood flow to the heart, a process called thrombolysis.  The
thrombolytic strategies compared in GUSTO use powerful drugs to break
up blood clots in heart vessels quickly and prevent clots from
recurring.  These strategies have never been compared directly in a
large-scale clinical trial until GUSTO.  The results are expected to
have an important impact on heart attack treatment worldwide.
   The press conference will be held at two locations: live at the
National Press Club, Main Lounge, 13th Floor, 529 14th St., N.W.,
Washington D.C., and via satellite at The Hotel Macklowe, 145 W. 44th

Subject: Mary and Idols
Organization: Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan
Lines: 78


 I have been studying the Bible now for about a year.  I love it,
but I am not very familiar with the different denominations, or
traditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups.
I have heard various people (outside this news group)
describe *idols* such as power, money, material 
possessions etc.  These things are worshiped in some sense I 
suppose, but I never really gave idols much thought.  Until now...  

I have been reading the postings in this news group (which I 
just found a few days ago), and I have a question...  First, I'm
not trying to question anyone's belief or try to push my views
on anyone else (I haven't been at this long enough to have
any views other than I cannot get to heaven by being good,
I must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so that
I could be saved and I need to repent, i.e. realize that
every time I sin, I might as well stick a sharp stick in
Christ's side because He took the punishment for my sins,
when He died on the cross).

In my studies, Mary never really comes up.  I know who she is, 
but that's about it.  It seems to me that a statue of Mary 
could be considered an idol?  Do people pray to statues of Mary?

It sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself
I'm sure) believe Mary was sinless?  Wow...  I hoped to spend
the summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about
Tongues (I'm reading ""Charismatic Chaos"").  I guess I'll study
Tongues in parallel with reading this news group.  Any help you can 
give me will be appreciated.

    -------------------------------------------

[I don't think the issue is so much that people are more educated than
you (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a
different tradition than yours.

This is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholics
generally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  The
issue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestants
generally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine.
Since this isn't in the Bible (except in passages that no one would
understand in this way if they didn't already believe it), Protestants
don't accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through the
Church, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible.

I interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about
whether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am
not prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in
learning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are of
course a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generally
consider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and
various subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, it's a matter
of how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major
division is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those
who don't.  There are also a number of major historical traditions,
but in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I'd 
identify the major Protestant traditions as:

  Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they're sort of halfway between
  Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,
  Church of Christ

But there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to
be so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think
current trends in society and the Church are also tending to make
conservatives seen themselves as allies from a general ""evangelical""
perspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still
quite marked.

I think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book
on church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really
needs to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history
will normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and
give a feeling for their nature.  Unfortunately I'm away from my
library at the moment, so I don't have anything specific to recommend.

Just because those  ""marriages"" are more stable and loving and long-lasting,

  Are there any members of conservative, religious, politically active groups
(such as the Christian Coalition) out there?  I come from a very liberal 
background, and I'd like to talk to some conservative people out there in a 
public forum (such as this one.)  I frankly can't understand the rationale or
Christian basis for much of the conservative position, and I'd like to try and
learn more about this movement--after all, we're part of the same church.  Is
anyone interested in explaining a bit about the conservative viewpoint?

If you read the last couple of books in the series closely (well, #3 and #4
at least), there are at least two points at which the real Question is
implied.  Conversations proceed much like:

Zaphod: What *is* the ultimate Question, I wonder?
Arthur (not paying much attention to Zaphod, but needing a random seed for
  the Infinite Improbability Drive): Think of a number, any number.

Actually, it may be Marvin who uses this phrase a few times as well, and
everytime it's arranged such that ""Think of a number, any number"" could be
an answer to someone's question about the Question.

I kind of like it.  Very mystifying.  It's not even ""pick a number"" or
""tell me a number"", just ""think of one"".

I don't think the issue of whether infants have faith is relevant or not.
Certainly they *can*, as the example of John in utero proves. I find the
translation of Col 2 above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ,
which the KJV and RSV put in terms of Christ's cricumcision which we, in
union with him *participate* in putting off the body of sins of the flesh.

Also, perhaps cor 2:12 is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism,
which can be independant of faith, from the experience of rising with
Christ by faith. Who says both are by faith? This interpretation has the
advantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized, for whom their
baptisim is not benefit, but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless.

Like the israelites (all of them, children included) who were baptized in
the cloud and in the sea, it was of no advantage because they did not add
to their baptism faith and obedience.

Baptism does not impart faith, nor is it done strictly speaking on the
basis of the faith of the parent, but because of the covcenant promise of
God. It imparts grace, the grace of the kingdom, which can be a
punishement in disguise if there is later apostacy.

Do you teach a child to pray the Lord's prayer? Do you expect them to not
steal? They *can* have faith appropriate to their condition. And in the
new covenant, we shall no longer say: know the lord, for they shall all
know him from the least unto the greatest Heb 8:11.

>If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty

But also according to Ezekiel 18, God will not hold innocent anyone on the
basis of anyone elses innocense. Thus Jesus could not be our federal head
any more than adam, *IF* that's what ezekiel is talking about. Shall you
make ezekiel 18 contradict the second commandemnt as well?

Ezekiel 36:25-26 indicates that this new heart will be given by God,
in the context of the sprinkling of water in baptism. It is the action of
God puting them into his new order, and not a question of""personal""
faith as such.

But the death that came to all because of sin is not just their personal
death, but the dead state (originbal sin). We are in a covenant of death,
because adam, our federal head gave over his dominion to the devil and death.

While this psalm is figurative in it's language, it is not hyperbolic, and
the one does not necessarily imply the other. There is not other
hyperbolic language in this psalm. What v 5 is likely refering to is 
what is symbolized by the OT cleanliness laws (which make intercourse and
childbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from God). The
whole psalm is in the language of OT ritual (hyssop, cleansing, burnt
offering, etc) David's sin with bathsheba included this element, as he
did not ritually cleanse himself when he should have. 

But what was symbolized by the OT ritual was the truth that sin was 
passed generationally. That's why the organ of generation had to be
cut. That's why brith was unclean. Uncleanness was death, and all babies
were born dead, and needed to be washed to newness of life, which we have in
baptism today.

G'day Brian,

I'll be blunt about this. The ONLY reasonable explanation of Roberts
algorithm is in

Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics
Rogers
McGraw-Hill Book Co. 1985

Go to the library and look at this.

There is also a somewhat muddled explanation in the first edition
of Newman and Sproull.

The algorithm described in PECG runs in near linear time.

i think you got it the other way round: the Ferrari flat 12 is a 180
degree v12 and not a ""true"" boxer, while the subaru and porsche are
true boxers.  don't know about the vw bug though, but i suspect that
it is also a true boxer.

I've got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery,
and on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme.  Ordinary massage
is intended to make a person feel better, especially if they have muscular
or joint problems.  But -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitioners
who take the technique to a far extreme, invoking what seems to me to be
quack science to justify their technique.

In the case of massage, there is a technique called ""deep abdominal massage""
in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines!
The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the
intestines and putrifies, releasing poisons which cause various disease
syndromes.  By this vigorous and painful procedure, it is alleged that
these deposits can be loosened up and passed out.

I just can't believe this idea has any truth behind it!  The human intestine
is not a New York City sewer pipe!  And even if it were, you eat half of
a small box of Triscuits, and there ain't gonna be nothin' sticking to the
inner surface of your intestine  :-)

Recently, I completed a 2 week juice fast (with 3 days of water) and had
two colonics as part of it.  My motivation was primarily spiritual, to
de-toxify from all the crap I've been putting in my body (not like thats
enough to clean it all out but it did have an effect).  Personaly, I
didn't find it an uncomfortable experience (the colonic), lost about
15lbs of beer belly (which hasn't come back over the last month), and
feel great.  One of the things that prompted me to get the colonic was
seeing my 90 year old grandmother chair ridden from colitis (?) from
years of indulgence.

Shaz,

Hmm.. but the service indicators that I have works this way:
  There are 5 green,1 yellow, 1 red indicators.
  initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start
  your car. The computer will actually ""sense"" how you drive your car and
  as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and
  then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go
  on. And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off.
  
  After service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the
  computer starts counting again.

So I expect to have a tool(or a procedure) to reset it so the green lights will 
come on and the yellow and red lights will go off.

I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the
indicator.

It's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a 
surprise to me. and it's a big plus :-). But I wonder how that could happen
since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time, I thought it's the oil and
not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil.

Any BMW owner on the net? Response welcomed.

PS.  my initial question is ""how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW""

NNTP-Posting-Host: phakt.usc.edu

Hi,
I need your help with a problem I have with a 1989 Mitsubishi
Galant GS transmission.  The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission.
Since the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd,  unless 
I do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a ""popping"" or ""hitting"" sound.
The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say 
this is NORMAL for the car.  IS IT?
And about a year ago, at 35Kmiles, the stick shift handle got STUCK
while attempting to put it in reverse:
   1- The shifter would not budge.  The clutch had no effect.
   2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is
      fully depressed.
   3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.
   4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was
      stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if
      it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)
   5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having 
      someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),
      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.
   6- The shifter acted normally after that.

When this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the 
clutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.

I had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last
week.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because 
Mitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the
problem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while
they had the car.  
In all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage,
and since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed
to the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily
solving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to
send someone to check the car while it was stuck. 
I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting 
from 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can't get 
the dealer to fix it. I need your help with the mechanical problems, 
and with how to handle Mitsubishi.  
All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and sorry to
bore you with the long post.

Thanks,
Rabih.

Yep, that's when I noticed it too. I stopped replacing the hood badge

I don't like the term ""quack"" being applied to a licensed physician David.
Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion).
I'll give you some examples.

	1. Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no 
	   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.

	2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid 
	   function for the purpose of quick weight loss.

	3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has 
	   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by 
	   the NCI.

These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should 
not committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of 
which result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal 
agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be 
having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of 
commission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to 
relieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures,
others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a 
chance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the 
healer's oath, ""I will do no harm"".  But you know David that very few 
treatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a 
very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each 
physician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some 
are very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive 
approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long 
as the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake 
in lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in 
the medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as 
quacks or even unethical.

What do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.  
These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the 
frustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are 
really doing a pretty good job of providing ""alternative"" medicine.  But 
many lack any formal training and are in the ""business"" simply to make a 
few fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting 
competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative 
care area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find 
someone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of 
money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo-
medical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the 
liscened physicians).

I hope that this clears things up David.

How is it that placebos are legal?  It would seem to me that if, as a patient,
you purchase a drug you've been prescribed and it's just sugar (or whatever),
there's a few legal complications that arise:

	1. 
If you have been diagnosed with a condition and you aren't given accepted
treatment for it, it seems like intentional medical malpractice.

	2.
A placebo should fall, legally, under the label of quackery (why not?)

	3.
Getting what you pay for.  (Deceptive ""bait and switch"" to an extreme...).  False
advertising  (what if McDonalds didn't put 100% pure beef in their hamburgers?)


	So I'm mystified.  Are these assumptions erred?  If they aren't, why the
hell can a doctor knowingly or unknowingly prescribe a placebo?

Well, here is something I wrote some time ago in response to a
similar question.  I hope it helps:

[Begin repeat of previous post]

As for the scripture mentioned I agree that it does seem to be a 
problem, not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general.  
Luke's version has Jesus saying that the children of this world 
marry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain
the kingdom of heaven.  It almost sounds like marriage disqualifies
one for salvation.  (Matthew and Mark both omit this statement.)   I
think the accounts are not as clear as they might be.  Let's have a
look at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable
ideas of what it means.  The scriptures involved are Mat 22:23-30,
Mark 12:18-25, and Luke 20:27-36.

What happened was that the Sadducees, who did not believe in the
resurrection, thought they could trap Jesus.  They made reference to
the ""Leverite"" marriage which required the brother of a man who died
without children to take the widow to wife and raise up children.  
The children would be considered children of the deceased, just as
though the woman's first husband had fathered them.  It seems
obvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be
the wife of her first husband.  However, the Sadducees concocted a
scene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to
father children by the widow.  They seem to imply that the Leverite
marriage was equal to the first for they ask, ""Whose wife shall she
be in the resurrection?""  At this point it seems obvious that if she
is anybody's wife, it is the first husband.  After all, had she
borne children they would have been credited to him regardless of
which brother was the biological father.  It is possible Jesus was
refering to this when he says, ""Ye do err, not knowing the
scriptures or the power of God."" (Mat 22:29, compare Mark 12:24,
phrase not in Luke's account).

Anyway, the Sadducees ask, ""Whose wife will she be in the
resurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?""  Jesus answer is that,
""In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in
marriage..."" (Mat 22:30) ""When they rise from the dead they neither
marry..."" (Mark 12:25)  ""They which are accounted worthy to obtain
that world neither marry..."" (Luke 20:35)  All 3 accounts go on to
say, ""but are as the angels in heaven"" or the equivalent.  I find
this last not very helpful since the Bible does not define angels
nor give any idea what their life is like.  (Some ministers claim
that they are sexless, different that humans etc. but I can find no
Biblical support for this.)

I think what Jesus is saying here (and it is clearest in Matthew's
and Mark's accounts) is that marriages will not be performed in the
resurrection.  This goes along with our belief that if a person is
to marry at all it must be done on this earth.  However, we do
believe that a marriage performed by the authority of God can be
binding in eternity.  In fact, the first marriage appears to have
been performed by God himself before death entered the world (in the
Garden of Eden).  What therefore God hath joined together, let not
man put asunder. (Mat 19:6)  Jesus also told Peter and the other
apostles that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be bound
in heaven (Mat 16:19, 18:18).  I believe that this also refers to
marriages performed by the proper authority.

No, they do not work well.  My doctor started using one recently, and I
thought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.  

The thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum.
The ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point
the thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear
to straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then
pushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong.
It is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on 
yourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees,
and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.  

I talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this,
and she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did give
me some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion
feels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly
on one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to
the company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company
had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end
of the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior
to reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree
of the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office.

I have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the
probe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, you
have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button
to get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect
that many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings for
yet another reason.

In short, it's a great idea.  It may work for some folks, but I believe
it doesn't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature.

For a reasonable sum, you can get a BMW with traction control:
a torque-sensing (limited slip) rear differential.  Since no
FWD car, including the Saab, has this kind of front differential,
since it would exacerbate torque steer, a BMW with traction control
should have the theoretical advantage on snow.  Of course weight

You are quite confident that essences do not exist.  How do propose to

Don't worry about this -- they'll drop you like a hot potato after you do
  make a claim. They'll just make filing the claim a pain, but it will end
  when they leave you in the lurch.

>>>I've read in this group that Geico has funded the purchasing of radar
>>>guns by police depts (I'm not sure where).
More than that. GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR. When locals 
  showed a reluctance to BUY the units, GEICO started giving them away. I
  know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff's a
  and some local governments.
The real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins. Co.s can
  tell which drivers represent risk. This is a determination they can make
  AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units. Most
  drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but 
  this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. It's called
  extra profits. They also know how silly the NSL is, and how it is almost
  universally ignored. Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket, an
  increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesn't make you
  a riskier driver to insure.
Like the sound of this? Like the people who thought up the scheme? Go GEICO!

Unless you have some driving history problems, you're usually better to go
with one of the major companies and stay there. You'll get long term customer
discounts on your premiums. Now, about the % of your premium that is paid as
commission. That's another story for another day.

    First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused about
this issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggest
that the weakness is your reference material.  Get ""An Introduction to Ray
Tracing"" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing
algorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.

    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up
all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For
example, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up
and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower
bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, you
get some illumination equation like this:

        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent

    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light
intensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less
hand-waving illumination equation is this:

        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt

    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the
material constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from
transparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a
purple-colored glass object.

    Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my ""illumination
equation sermon"" to you also.

NOW!  The point that I'll try to make is that coincidences like this occur
with a very high frequency.  How many of us have been thinking of someone
and had that person call?  Much of the whole psychic phenomenon is easily
explicable by this - one forgets the misses.  Consider your astrological

The alt.* hierarchie is created for 2 purposes:
1. For groups which do not fit under the comp.* or other 'official'
  hierarchies
2. For the fast creation of hot new newsgroups like alt.gulf.war

Because there is no voting process or any other control facilities,
sites are free to decide not to carry (some of) the alt groups.

Therefore, it is (I think) desirable to try to create comp.graphics.

There is the possibility that there is some degree of constipation causing

I'm also interested in such a program. But most of all I'd like to know 
wich program is able to convert GIF or PCX to DXF !!! When I have this

This will be beyond the limit !!!

   I don't think Joe was saying any such thing.  However, your question
on ""asking Jesus to come into your heart"" seems to imply that infants
are not allowed to have Christ in theirs.  Why must Baptism always be
viewed by some people as a sort of ""prodigal son"" type of thing; i.e. a
sudden change of heart, going from not accepting Christ to suddenly
accepting Christ?  Why can't people start out with Christ from shortly
after birth, and build their relationship from there?  After all, does
a man suddenly meet a woman, and then marry her that same day?  From my
experiences, I've learned that all relationships must be built,
including one's relationship with God.

   Also Joe is speaking from the standpoint that Baptism is not just a
ritual, but that through it God bestows sacramental grace upon the
recipient.  Certainly for those with the mental faculties to know Christ
it is necessary to believe in Him.  However, the Sacrament itself
bestows grace on the recipient, and makes a permanent mark of adoption
into God's family on the soul.

Catholics believe in both!  But that doesn't mean that anyone has come

Now, now, before we get too carried away here....

Keep in mind that owning any car in Korea is a luxury that only the ruling
class can afford.  Every government agency worth its salt finds some reason
to levy a tax on car ownership; last I heard, there were seven different
fees to pay to own a car.  I believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic
inefficiency that new President Kim Young Sam wants to eradicate.  Basically,
I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds
wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class.  In exchange, zaibatsu's like
Hyundai screwed over smaller companies, perpetuating a vicious cycle.
I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone
else, but for now Hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society,
of screwy components that won't work together.  Stubborn like a mule, the
car either won't go forward or won't stop at all.

-Allergy medicine, huh?  Is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine or
whatever, or does it actually suppress allergic reactions? (i.e. like an
antihistamine does?)  As far as doctors over here are concerned, if you slip up
and eat something you're allergic to (even if they won't test you to tell you
what to avoid) then tough; if a _cheap_ medicine will alleviate your symptoms,
then fine, otherwise you just suffer.  One doctor did prescribe me imigran (costs
the NHS #48 for 6 tablets) after having to rehydrate me because I'd been throwing
up for four solid days and couldn't even drink water - but I got taken off it
again when I moved and had to change doctors.  Reasoning: they did not know what
the side-effects were because it was new.  OK, fine - but it has passed the
safety tests to get on the prescription list, and anyway I was prepared to take
the risk to have quality of life now.  The only alternatives I have is to get it
prescribed privately, which I cannot afford, or to pay a private allergy
specialist to test me and tell me what to avoid.  I am fairly certain I am
allergic to more than one chemical additive, as a lot of things I can't eat have
nothing in common except things I know are safe, so testing myself isn't really
an option; there are too many permutations.

Yes, I've noticed that - and I can work it up by eating just under the tolerance
level fairly regularly.  If I don't eat anything except home cooking for a month
or so I lose it and have to work it up from scratch... a bad experience.  Now I

allergic to food before I've eaten too much of it... usually...

I pity those who hope that medical knowledge can resolve issues
such as this.  This issue has been rehashed in sci.med time and
time again.  The bottom line is this: in normal circumstances,
both the medical advantages of and the medical risks of
circumcision are minor.  This means that the decision is left to
the religious, cultural, ethical, and aesthetic mores of the
parents, at best, or to the habit of the concerned hospital or
caregivers, at worst. 

As (prospective) parents, you should do what you want in this
regard and not worry about it too much.  In terms of decisions
you make for your child, it will have far less importance than
many -- such as which schools you choose -- that most parents
think about only a little. 

This question will undoubtedly push the buttons of people who
feel that the decision to circumcise your infant or not is a
momentous medical decision.  It is not.

Curiously enough, this subject has occupied a good bit of my prayer life
recently.  God's experience of time is so completely different from our own,
since He is both within and without it.  Using words like ""foreknowledge""
and ""predestination"" are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing
God's perception of our action, because, for God, the beginning, living, and
ending of our lives are all the same.  Sort of.  For God, there is no ""before""
when He did not know, so he could not have ""foreknowledge"" of our lives or
a time when he could have ""predestined"" our actions.  In fact, since our
understanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time, I
would say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our
free will interacts with God's control of the universe.

I think I can explain the ""missing part of a leaf"" story.

I have actually seen a reproduction of that particular Kirlian
photograph, in a book compiled by people who were enthusiasts of
Kirlian photography.  ""That particular photograph"" ... ?  That's
right, the effect has been observed only once.  Even the writers of
the book were inclined to disbelieve in it.  

I conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placing
a whole leaf between two plates and taking its Kirlian photo.
For his next experiment, he cut the leaf in half, put one half down
between the same two plates, and took another K. p.  The
""missing half"" effect was created by water, oils, etc. left behind 
after the first photo.

This explanation must be tentative, because after all I wasn't there
when it happened.

I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion
one way or another on hidden candida infections.  I can
understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with
various general kinds of symptoms, while there is a lack of solid
demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms.
(To understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of past
failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of
hidden candida infection.  There have been quite a few, and the
proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.)

On the other hand, I am happy to read that some people are
sufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred by
suggestive clinical experience, to research it further.  The
doubters may be surprised.  (It has happened before.)

I realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may
not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or
another.  (And, indeed, perhaps some of them do know -- I am the
one who is currently ignorant.)  But I find this the most honest
route, and so I am happy with it.

I have proposed the forming of a consortium/task force for the promotion
of NAPLPS/JPEG, FIF to openly discuss ways, method, 
procedures,algorythms,
applications, implementation, extensions of NAPLPS/JPEG standards.
These standards should facilitate the creation of REAL_TIME Online
applications that make use of Voice, Video, Telecommuting, HiRes 
graphics,
Conferencing, Distant Learning, Online order entry, Fax,in addition
these dicussion would assist all to better understand how SGML,CALS,
ODA,MIME,OODBMS,JPEG,MPEG,FRACTALS,SQL,CDrom,cdromXA,Kodak PhotoCD,TCL,
V.FAST,EIA/TIA562,can best be incorporated and implemented to
develop TELEMATIC/Multimedia applications....
 
We want to be able to support DOS, UNIX, MAC, WINDOWS, NT, OS/2 
platforms.
It is our hope that individuals,developers, corporations, Universities,
R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.
 
This would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter. Already 
many
corporation have decided to support OTG (Open TELEMATIC Group) so do not 
delay joining if you are a developer
 
An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon be 
be compose to start promulgating what is known on the subject.
If you would like to be added to the mailist send email or mail to
the address below. 
 
This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPS/JPEG newsletter
as well as a hardcopy version.
We urge all who wants to see CMCs HiRes based applications
& the NAPLPS/JPEG G R O W,  decide to join and mutually benefit from 
this NOT-FOR_PROFIT endeavor.
 
NOTE: Telematic has been defined by Mr. James Martin as the marriage
      of Voice, Video, Hi-res Graphics, Fax, IVR, Music over telephone
      lines/LAN.

I've had three children and the pain was different in degree for each.  I

to be, when I saw a relative with one.  I bet they depend, too--some are

PEXLIB and PHIGS (as it comes from MIT with PEX and as is explained in the
PHIGS Programming Manual) are just different API's for the PEX protocol,
which is an extension to the X protocol.

So it depends on You, what you go to use.

Advantage of Phigs is the protability to other platforms (IBM GraPhigs, 
SunPhigs) and the standardized structuring of the 3D objects.

Advantage of PEXlib is the sometimes faster and easier programming for
immediate mode graphics, because PEX is not an exactly mapping of Phigs
to a Prortocol.

If we take things this literally then we must also forbid women from
speaking in church. Paul while led by the holy spirit was human and could
err. I find it interesting that CHRIST never discussed the issue of
homosexuality, certainly it existed back then and if it was a serious
transgression CHRIST would have condemned it. 
I find it disturbing that the modern church spends its energy trying
to stamp out something that CHRIST didn't consider worth a single word
of condemnation. CHRIST repeatedly warns us against judgement. 
Don't we risk ""judgement in equal measure"" when we condemn people who 
GOD himself did not judge when he walked on the earth?

There is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the Bimmer service lights.
It will cost you 45$ from a mailorder, and buying one far outweighs
the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try
di it yourself. 
You wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset.
Why is reseting so important? The only reason for doing
it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you. 
Forget this 'in european cars you only need to change the oil every
15000' crap. Anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape, and
extending its life, will change it every 3000, (inc filter). Don't wait
for the servive lights to come on before servicing the car. 
I bought a bmw about 6 months ago, it had 3 green lights on. I have changed
the oil every 3000, completly flushed brake fliud, changed all filters(oil,
air and fuel, changed transmission and drive oils
and done almost all of the other things req for service 1
and a service 2. After nearly 6000 miles, I am still on 2 green lights.
After a winter in Burlington (and it is snowing today!!) that is not bad.

Good luck!

Look be consistent. First you post something that seems to suggest that you see
xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error. 
So I post and asy it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that. 
So you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, I have misunderstood
etc.
Now you are saying:

If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the

No I don't think so actually. 

You were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising),
manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these
changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. Xv lets you edit individual
colours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?

I do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.

What are you saying

Ah! now we see thew problem! First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8
bit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are
saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those
parts of the program that cause the problem!!

Not sure what you are saying here. Certainly one can make local changes.

Yes that is one possible approach. I would find a program that took such an

Well here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. You don't seem
to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the
next. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one
through.

>>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

>It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not
>designed for that.

As I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of
saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what
the problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives.

>Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; 

Speak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,
having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow
reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made
to the 8 bit image palette.

Perhaps that is why you yused the singular?

>say,
>person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is
>expected that the image still is the same. 

Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main
control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit
image. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit
file. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.

>So, XV were designed
>without thinking about human interface and how human expect the

Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)

Read my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets

Argh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it
if it is so easy.

Or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.

I think this is a bit of an exageration.

What you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in

As a matter of fact, I just saw a dermatologist the other day, and while I 
was there, I asked him about dry skin. I'd been spending a small fortune
on various creams, lotions, and other dry skin treatments.
He said all I needed was a large jar of vaseline. Soak in a lukewarm tub
of water for 10 minutes (ONLY 10 minutes!) then massage in the vaseline,
to trap the moisture in. That will help. I haven't tried it yet, but you
can bet I will. The hard part will be finding the time to rub in the
vaseline properly. If it's not done right, you remain greasy and stick
to your clothes.
Try it. It's got to be cheaper then spending $30 for 8 oz. of 'natural'
lotion.

The DeLorean had the yucky PRV V6 engine. A joint-venture between Peugout (note

junk with approx 140hp. Doesn't like revs at all.

If you look at the DeLorean in the movie Back To the Future you will note
that they changed the engine sound to a big V8. A real DeLorean doesn't sounds
half as good. You will also note that every time they have to spin the tires
in the movie the ground is all wet. This is because a DeLorean can't make
a burnout on a dry road! The weak engine thats mounted over the rear axle
makes it almost impossible.

That would be the Opel GT, sold in this country from '69 to '73.  It originally
had a 1100 cc engine, which was later replaced by the 1900 cc.  It was based
on the old Kadett drive train and suspension, with leaf springs in the rear
and a single transverse leaf spring in the front.  It looked good, but was
limited as a performer.

There has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other
models.  In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models, the 1900 series, that
were also known as model numbers 51, 57, etc.  These cars had the newer
1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes, a station wagon,
and a ""sport coupe"", known in Europe as the Manta.  At the same time, there
were two 30-series cars, which sold very few numbers, that also had the 1900
engine but the Kadett suspension.  The sport coupe, (model 57) was also
available as the Rallye, (57R), with a blacked out hood, tach, and fog lights,
but was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio.

In 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US.  1973 was the last
year for the GT in any country, both because of the US bumper height regulations
and the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing
to build the GTs.

The 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences.  In 1975, the
Manta, 1900 sedan (also called the Ascona) and the wagon were available with
Bosch electronic fuel injection.  These cars also had larger brakes and
wider wheels.  These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Century
low price leader of the time, and were the last Opels imported into the US.

From 1976 to 1979, cars that sported Buick/Opel badges were still sold by
the Buick dealers, but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks.  The idea was to call them
Opels instead of changing the dealers' neon signs.

Various models of the 50-series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the
70's in their class, and were known as serious 2002-competition.

Parts are still available from a number of sources.

(I still have a '73 manta and two '75 sedans and all the trick parts I could
collect in 20 years).

Are you sure you want to include Chalcedon here?  I presume that you 
mean the description of Jesus as fully human and fully devine.  Almost 
everyone would consider the majority of Copts and Armenians, and the 
Jacobites, as Christians, yet for 15 centuries it has been maintained 
that they disagree with the Formula of Chalcedon.  Those that wouldn't 
consider them Christians are most likely to object that these communities 
don't require a personal commitment to Jesus, which is only tangentially 
related to the Formula of Chalcedon.

Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as

systemic candida infection.  I think ""The Yeast Connection"" is

Well, maybe I'm getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast
was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the
mold form.  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds, 
depending on environment.  Candida exibits what is known as
reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues
but exists as a yeast in the environment.  Should we maybe
call it a mold infection?  a fungus infection?  Maybe we
should say it is caused by a mold-like fungus.

Diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels.  The main reason
they are considered ""cleaner"" is because they are better at the emissions we
actually measure and regulate.  But they also contribute additional emissions
which have long been determined to be as harmful, but no suitable control or
limits have been defined.  

Current evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissions
and suspended particles and less of a photo-chemical reaction.  Diesel particulates
are now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity.  And alcohols emit
signifcantly more aldehydes (a known carcinigen) than gasoline.  The evidence
is mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we may
have been ignoring the effects of the alternatives.

And anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours in
rush hour traffic in some cities in Europe.  There the stench of the diesels is
awful and it can even burn the eyes.  

Diesels being clean is only relative to our current standards.

 ""Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Orthopedic Surgeon"" Journal of 
the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. 269,  No. 14, P. 1807  (von 
Reyn, C. Fordham) 

     The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to  patient is 
extremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universal 
infection control procedures, write C.  Fordham von Reyn et al. of the 
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted 
2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed 
invasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  
orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive 
for HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, 
representing 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon 
performed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were 
tested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All 
patients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  
assay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  
The examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect 
cases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of 
the initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single 
most  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 
percent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were 
conducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who 
was an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  
Notifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive 
and expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \

269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) 

     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be 
quantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar 
investigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins 
University School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a 
total of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  
procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was 
listed as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for 
all patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were 
obtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 
had  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No 
study patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly 
detected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably 
infected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 
person-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to 
patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours 
of surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  
suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control 
guidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to 
be tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was 
found to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably 
the result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  
there is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive 
surgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude.

 ""Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data"" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  
(Kolata, Gina) 

     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly 
unusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are 
undergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the 
Merck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He 
said that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it 
had  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective 
in fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that 
HIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at 
different sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the 
mutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one 
after the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies 
do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new 
agreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data 
on new AIDS drugs.  ""An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate

companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a 
much more  efficient way,"" said Scolnick.  He also said that the  
collaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, 
Merck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  
Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute 
of Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, ""We're delighted to see the  
pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the 
information flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for 
AIDS.""  Related Stories: Wall Street Journal (04/20) P. B1; Philadelphia

""The Next Step in AIDS Treatment"" Nature (04/08/93) Vol. 362, No. 6420, P. 493  
(Maddox, John) 

     Although AZT was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives  of 
people infected with HIV, the findings do not indicate that  AZT should not be 
administered in people with full-blown AIDS,  writes columnist John Maddox.  
AZT has been used in the United  States in asymptomatic HIV-positive people on 
the basis that  administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of  
T-cell counts.  However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should 
not be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 
people given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving 
only placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the 
proportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to 
death were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  
conclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected 
individuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the 
progression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study 
of the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already 
appeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  
evidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has 
proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV 
infection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the 
beginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of 
disease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself 
provide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  
Maddox.

Women"" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe 
et al.) 

     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM 
type in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of 
HIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the

National AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized 
that  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  
presence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in 
breastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were 
enrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 
months, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were 
assayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  
protein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral 
genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of 
primers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post 
partum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 
percent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; 
and IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived 
longer than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of 
persistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-
infected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of 
HIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  
The  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM 
response was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in 
breastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers 
conclude.

""Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture"" Journal of Commerce 
(04/21/93), P. 7A 

     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced 
Tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS 
research to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV 
infection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily 
from the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies 
since  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual 
AIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories, 
led the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come 
together, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companies 
involved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are  
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche, 
Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck, 
Syntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.  The 
participants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they 
were aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively  
involved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.  Scolnick said the 
collaborators would most likely meet every couple of  months for a daylong 
scientific meeting where they will review  for one another their preclinical

It sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not
actually using the Valentine-1.  I'd like to give some feedback based on
real life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode
and it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does
is when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes
sense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different
directions.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its
reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.

I have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case
there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I
passed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then
the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With
other radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.
But with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there
was another trap.  And there was!

On other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from
a true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator
changes.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where
the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the 
place.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector
that leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the
car passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would
have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar
trap when there was none.

I've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features
to be useful and not gimmicks.

well, i have lots of experience with scanning in images and altering
them.  as for changing them back into negatives, is that really possible?
scanning and altering is no big deal. i don't know what types of
features you have in your version of photoshop.  but the one i use
(which, incidentally is on a quadra) has gallery effects and all types
of other neato stuff.
i'm just wondering why you would want to put your images back into
negatives, because once you print the image out-that's your print.
do you know what exactly your aim is in all of this?  like, are you
doing this just for fun, for a business, to gain more computer
knowledge, for a project you're working on....
otherwise, i guess i don't know if i'd be helping or not by posting info
on scanning and stuff.

Heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity, innocence
and modesty, and their importance.



    The Most Beautiful Virtues

    This story is an excerpt taken from The  Basket  of  Flowers   by
    Johann Christoph von Schmid


    In a certain little market town, over a hundred years ago,	there
    lived  an  upright	and  intelligent man named Jacob Rede. He was
    married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily  in
    a  humble  home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val-
    ley. After living many, happy years together, Jacob's wife	died,
    leaving  him alone with only one friend...his daughter Mary. Even
    as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in  years,
    her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss
    towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty  a  rare
    and  peculiar  charm. Her face was lighted up with a look of such
    indescribable goodness, that  it  seemed  almost  as  though  one
    looked upon an angel.

    Mary's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her  favour-
    ite  flowers  were the violet, the lily and the rose. Jacob loved
    to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming  to  her
    gender.  When	she  once, early in March brought the first violet to
    him and joyfully called upon him to admire it, he said:

    Let the modest violet, my dear Mary, be to you an image of humil-
    ity  and  of the benevolence that does good in secret. It clothes
    itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to  bloom  in
    retired  grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain-
    ing hidden beneath the leaves.  May you also, my  dear  Mary,  be
    like  the  retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to
    attract the public	eye,  but  preferring  ever  to  do  good  in
    quietude and peace.

    One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and  the
    garden appeared in its richest array, Jacob said to his daughter,
    as he pointed out a beautiful lily,  which	was  beaming  in  the
    morning sun:

    Let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem
     of purity. Look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! The whi-
    test  linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals:
    they are like the snow. Happy the maiden whose heart is  as  pure
    and as free from stain. But the purest of all colours is also the

    Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was  one
    that  was  prized above all the others. It was an apple tree, not
    much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in  the  middle
    of	the garden. Mary's father had planted it the day that she was
    born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. Once it
    blossomed  earlier	than  usual  and with unusual luxuriance. The
    tree was one mass of blossom. Mary was so delighted with it  that
    she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at
     it. Once, when it was in full bloom, she called  to  her  father
    and said:

    Look father, how beautiful! Was there ever such a lovely mingling
    of	red  and  white?  The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of
    flowers!

    The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast  her  eyes
    once  more	upon the tree. But what was her grief to see that the
    frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. They were  all
    become  brown  and	yellow	and  when  the	sun came forth in its
    strength they withered and fell to the ground. Mary  wept  bitter
    tears at the sight. Then said the father:

    Thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the  bloom  of  youth.  Oh  my
    child,  never  cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced
    from the path of right! Behold in the example of the  apple  tree
    an	image of what would happen if you were to wander from the way
    - if the hopes your conduct  hitherto  has	raised	in  my	heart
    should  vanish,  not  merely for a day or year, but for life. Ah,
    then how much more bitter would be the tears which I  would  shed
    over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your
    cheeks! Life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes  I
    should

				   -6-







    go down sorrowfully to my grave.

    As he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; Mary was deeply  moved,
    and  the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her
    mind that she never forgot them.

    Under the eyes of a father so  loving  and	wise,  and  amid  the
    flowers  of  her  garden, Mary grew daily in stature and intelli-
    gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a  lily  and  retiring	as  a
    violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom.

    Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously  the
    fruits  of	his  garden  rewarded his diligent toil; but with how
    much more happiness and content did he mark the  gracious  effect
    produced  upon  the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his
    pious teaching and example.

    Jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them together	in  a
    bunch and gave them to Mary with the words:

    The lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one
    to	the  other;  both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren-

I had a similar experience.  We had a written quote which had been mailed
to us from the salesman at one of these ""no-haggle"" Toyota dealers for
a Camry XLE w/ABS, leather, etc.  The price seemed fair, but when we
went in to take them up on their offer, they ""discovered"" that certain
extra cost items hadn't been included in their original written quote.
It would have totaled an extra $1100 and, in spite of the fact that we
had a written quote, they said there was nothing they could do.

Bottom line, quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that
the Toyota dealers think they've got such a superior auto that they
don't have to deal.  We walked, went out and bought a new LH car
(Eagle Vision TSI) and I don't regret it one bit!

I suppose you don't know what about we have discussed.
We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,
and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.

So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there
must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway,
and I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such
problems to my programs in the first place.

Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image
as I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image
back to 24 bit image.


>>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How
>>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global
>>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and
>>>much more complicated.

Ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit
and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,
jumps off the discussion a bit.

My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit
image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.


About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:
changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most
cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may
make serious errors to anywhere in the image.
XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the
mentioned type images.

Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global
changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like
paint program job.
If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the
original 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit
image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to
modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if
image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7
cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --
selecting individual color is possible from that.

Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen
such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention
24bit painting program in 8bit screen...


>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not
designed for that.
Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,
person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is
expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed
without thinking about human interface and how human expect the
program work -- design error.

I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but
it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making
major change to the original design.

So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved
images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.

Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where
'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes
up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,
even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.
(Americans: the lift is just an example :)


Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to
read it.

IMHO this are going from bad to worse. 3-in-1, 1-in-3 was bad enough.
 
I do not like a God who prays to Himself.  I refuse to believe Jesus prayed
to Himself  --   let's get real, if the scriptures say He prayed to the
Father, then the Father IS someone different than the Son.  I have no
problems with multiple Gods.  To me, the whole context of the scriptures
says:  Be perfect, even as your Father Who is in Heaven; that we can be
co-heirs with Christ; that we will be like Him.
 
Co-heirs share all things equally--including knowledge, power, dominion etc.
When I am like Him (Christ), I will be the same as HE is--and He is a God.
 
If God cannot do this, the His is not all powerful--and He is NOT God.
If He will not, He is a Liar--and He is NOT God.
 
But if He does, He is the greatest of all the Gods.
 

[I don't know of anyone who says that Jesus prayed to himself.  The
whole point of the Trinity is that there's enough of a distinction
within God that relationship is possible.  This implies some sort of
communication.  I assume that in their ""native"" form, the Father and
Son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense isn't
involved.  But Jesus is the incarnation of the Son, i.e.  the Logos
made flesh.  When he's in a human form, his human actions are limited
to human capabilities.  So communication with the Father takes the
form of prayer.  I don't see that there's anything problematical about
that.  It seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation.

There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights

About changing oil every 15,000 miles.... thats ok.... on newer Audis, they

Just a query: do you drive your car VERY VERY carefully? Like no sudden

But if you drive kinda fast... I'd get a bit up tight abot that 15,000 thingy

Just for the record, read your owner's manual before attempting a push start.
Most manufacturers today do not recommend this (I think the catalytic converter
is the primary reason - unburned gas goes down to it and may ignite when
the converter gets into its operating range).

The best reason for a manual? Because you like to drive one. I find that its
much easier to develop lazy habits in an auto trans car. Remember, pay 
attention out there - stupidity behind the wheel has still taken more people
to the morgue than drunk driving. The problem is that we don't revoke peoples

Last year, I was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an
inguinal hernia.  I couldn't remember doing anything that would have
caused it.  That is, I hadn't been lifting more than other people do,
and in fact probably somewhat less.  Eventually the thing became more
painful and I had the repair operation.

This year I developed a pain on the other side.  This turned out to be
another inguinal hernia.  So I go back to the hospital Monday for
another fun 8-) operation.

I don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen.  I'm 38
years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start falling
apart like this.  The surgeon who is doing the operation seems to
suspect a congenital weakness, but if so, why did it suddenly appear
when I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was younger?

Does anyone know how to prevent a hernia, other than not lifting
anything?  It's rare that I lift more than my 16-month-old or a sack
full of groceries, and you may have noticed that your typical grocery
sack is fairly small these days.  Is there some sort of exercise that
will reduce the risk?

It is important if Christianity is being damaged by it. If
people who ""speak in tongues"" make claims that they are
miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of
the Holy Spirit, when it can easily be shown that they are simply
making noises, it damages all Christians, since many who are
not Christians do not distinguish between the various sects.

The more modest claim for ""tongues"" that it is simply
uncontrolled praise in which ""words fail you"" is surely the one
that should be used by those who make use of this practice.

I agree with the point that ""Charismatic"" practices like this
can lead to forms of worship which are more about the
worshipper showing off than genuine praise for God; one of the
things Jesus warned us about.

When I was a school boy, my biology teacher told us of an incident
in which a couple were very passionate without actually having
sexual intercourse.  Somehow the girl became pregnent as sperm
cells made their way to her through the clothes via persperation.

Was my biology teacher misinforming us, or do such incidents actually
occur?

The cited passages are covered IN DEPTH in a FAQ for this group.
That particular FAQ (I've forgotten the author) discusses the
traditional vs. pro-homosexual interpretations of the passages and
indicates which points have strong textual support.

Perhaps the moderator might give again the instructions for
retrieving the FAQ on this topic?

BTW, this issue, while dealt with before, is VERY timely.  One
of the major Presbyterian churches in California (St. Andrews -- a 
MegaChurch in a rich neighborhood) is withholding their support of 
Synod (amounts to about 10% of the budget of the Synod, which 
covers all of Southern CA and Hawaii) until support for a 
pro-homosexual lobbying group (the Lazarus Project) is terminated.
[This came from a news report on CNN yesterday -- corrections welcome.]

[I think it's time for me to post the FAQ.  

This is an issue throughout the Presbyterian Church.  On the other
side, one of the major churches in Cincinnati has been ordaining
homosexual elders, and has ignored Presbytery instructions not to do
so.  And the church in Rochester where the judicial commission said
they couldn't install a homosexual pastor has made her an
""evangelist"".  These situations, as well as the one you describe, do
not appear to be stable.  This will certainly be a major topic for the
General Assembly next month.  If the church can't come up with a
solution that will let people live with each other, I think we're end
up with a split.  Clearly neither side wants that, but I think we'll
get pushed into it by actions of both sides.

This really bugs me.  The emissions of diesels are the cleanest of any vechicle,
but they are considered so polluting that they are banned in passenger cars
in California.  What a bunch of crap.  Diesel is the fuel of choice for 
enviromental benefit in Europe while here it's illegal for the same reason.

The particulates are nothing but carbon.  They are just an annoyance at worst.
Nothing beats the diesel cycle for efficiency and emissions, torque or engine
durability.  It's also cheaper.

Well, it depends on what kind of locking lugnuts you have.  My previous
car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5oz. more than the others. 
The locking lugnuts were factory equipment, and according to the factory
service manual, after tire balancing the technician/mechanic was
supposed to put a 1/2 oz. counterweight on the rim opposite the locking
nut.  I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no
one ever did the service correctly. I eventually got rid of the locking
lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts.  Unfortunately, I
found out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid
of the locking nuts. :-(

My present car, a Saturn SC, has locking lugnuts that I bought at the
dealer and are made specifically for the Saturn.  They have been made to
be exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts (said so on the
package and I verified it myself).  I haven't had any vibration problems
with the tires at all (due to the nuts) in 12,000 of ownership.  I did
have some other vibration problems, but it was due to a poor job of tire
balancing.

14. Plotting packages
=====================

Gnuplot 3.2
-----------
  It is one of the best 2- and 3-D plotting packages, with
  online help.It's a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
  for UNIX, MSDOS, Amiga, Archimedes, and VMS platforms (at least!).
  Freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers
  and is easily extensible to include new devices.
  It was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches.
  You can practically find it everywhere (use Archie to find a site near you!).
  The comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of Gnuplot.

Xvgr and Xmgr (ACE/gr)
-----------------------
  Xmgr is an XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations using
  X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for
  Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr.
  Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1
  and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.

  Check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in
  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.09.tar.Z (Motif version)
  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xvgr-2.09.tar.Z (XView version)

  Comments, suggestions, bug reports to Paul J Turner
  <pturner@amb4.ese.ogi.edu> (if mail fails, try pturner@ese.ogi.edu).
  Due to time constraints, replies will be few and far between.

Robot
-----
  Release 0.45 : 2-D and limited 3-D. Based on XView 3, written
  in C / Fortran (so you need a Fortran compiler or the f2c translator).
  Mainly tested on Sun4, less on DECstations. Check at
  ftp.astro.psu.edu (128.118.147.28),  pub/astrod.

VG plotting library
-------------------
  This is a library of Fortran callable routines at sunspot.ceee.nist.gov
  [129.6.64.151]

Xgobi
-----
  It's being developed at Bellcore, and its speciality are
  multidimensional data sets analysis and exploration. You can call it
  from the S language also, and it works as an X11 client using the Athena
  widget set (or with an ASCII terminal). It's distributed free of charge
  from STATLIB at CMU.
  To get it via e-mail, send email to statlib@temper.stat.cmu.edu and
  in the body area of the message, put the line

  send xgobi from general

  If you want to pick it via ftp, connect to lib.stat.cmu.edu. Log in as
  ""statlib"" and use your e-mail address as your password. Then type

  cd general
  mget xgobi.*

  Warning: It's about 2 MB sources + large Postscript manual. Read the
  relevant README to decide whether you need it or not.

PGPLOT
------
  Runs on VAX/VMS and supposedly on UNIX. It's a set of fortran routines freely

-------------------------
  
  This version V6.0 is based on Gregory Bond's version V5-beta. Added
  some stuff for scientific graphs, i.e. log axes, free scalable axes,
  XY-lineplots and some more, and re-added plotter callbacks from V4, e.g.
  to request the current pointer position, or to cut off a rectangle from the
  plotting area for zooming-in. Version V6.0 has a log of bugs fixed and a
  log of improvements against V6-beta. Additionally I did some other
  changes/extensions, besides 
  
  -     Origin and frame lines for axes.
  -     Subgrid lines on subtic positions.

PLPLOT
------
  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems, small (micro)
  and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness,
  it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:
  standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,
  mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or
  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each
  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually
  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are
  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four
  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and
  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.
  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),
  including a portable metafile format and renderer.
  
  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on

15. Image analysis software - Image processing and display
==========================================================

PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)
======================

IMDISP
------
  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,
  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS
  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions
  [PC and Macs]

LabVIEW 2
---------
  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a
  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the
  ""program"" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.
  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a
  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the
  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and
  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any
  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real
  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual
  instrument.

  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)
  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time
  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for
  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The
  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block
  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming
  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:
  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters
  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C
  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual
  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.

  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an
  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level
  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level
  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.

  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has
  utility functions for memory management data communications and
  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for
  the development of custom code.)

Ultimage Concept VI
-------------------
  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual
  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end
  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.
  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory
  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,
  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,
  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.

  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further
  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of
  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and
  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical
  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and
  characterization.

  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel
  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and
  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can
  be imported.

  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial
  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic
  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological
  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole
  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.
  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and
  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of
  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and
  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The
  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom
  modules.

  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity
  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can
  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight
  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging
  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are
  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local
  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.
  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as
  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)
  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening
  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.

  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even
  hole filling.

  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,
  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.

IPLab Spectrum
--------------
  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the
  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by
  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user
  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far
  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool
  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a
  movie command for cycling through windows.

  Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)
  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.
  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,
  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting
  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of
  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined
  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw
  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also
  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,
  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac
  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version
  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)

Adobe Photoshop
---------------

  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey
  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with
  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS
  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.
  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted
  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For
  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from
  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,
  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include
  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation
  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to
  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,
  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.

  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard
  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,
  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe
  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,
  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,
  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..

ColorStudio and ImageStudio
---------------------------
  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has
  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and
  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to
  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The
  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can
  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a
  variety of powerful selection tools including the ""auto selection tool""
  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close
  hues, color range and mask.

Digital Darkroom
----------------
  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and
  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to
  select part of an image simply by ""painting"" it. A new polyline
  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide
  selections.  A brush lets the operator ""paint"" with a selected portion
  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.
  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale
  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as
  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

  enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and
  unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There
  is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write
  your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however
  Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in
  the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching
  tool and it is very good for this purpose.""

Enhance
-------
  Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally
  provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter
  variations: ""Laplacian, medium noise filter"", etc.  Files can be saved
  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).

Image Analyst
-------------
  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative
  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure
  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the
  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such
  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video
  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in
  radiographs.

  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video
  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of
  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine
  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature
  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst
  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or
  a disk-stored image.

  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user
  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.
  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically
  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.
  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and
  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and
  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR
  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.

  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence
  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user
  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)
  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the
  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,
  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and
  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so
  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also
  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

AIPS
----
  Astronomical Image Processing System.  Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu
  (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)
  Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,
  VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,
  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)
  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),
  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building
  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.
     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is
  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy
  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a
  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything
  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.
  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based
  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware
  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and
  can do image arithmetic, etc.
    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is
  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and
  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.
     There is currently a project - ""AIPS++"" - underway to rewrite the
  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an
  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for
  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be
  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with
  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and
  Australia to name a few.

DISIMP
------
  (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful
  system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in
  interactive times.

  Feature Description

  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and
  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the
  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image
  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that
  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of
  modules.

  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and
  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and
  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and
  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and
  ratioing.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more
  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.
  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using
  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific
  applications programs.

  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick
  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,
  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be
  interactively driven through this control.

  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of
  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of
  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential
  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be
  added to further enhance referenced imagery.

  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels
  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help
  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The
  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional
  processing of remote sensed data.

  the final display. Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,
  automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to
  byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically
  and carefree.

  It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that
  difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.

  Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for
  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000
  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display""

HIPS
----
(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)

  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image
  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image
  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil
  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of
  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has
  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well
  as a huge user-contributed library.

  Feature description

  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide
  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,
  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images
  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.

  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image
  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform
  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital
  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image
  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs
  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task
  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows
  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users
  become effective using HIPS on their first day.

  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in
  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been
  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines
  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and
  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX
  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual
  pages, and on-line documentation.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents
  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing
  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating
  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation
  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.
  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and
  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.
  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and
  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and
  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a
  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun
  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X
  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an
  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS
  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with
  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-
  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices
  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.

  Availability

  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an
  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It
  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS
  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or
  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of
  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

MIRA
----
[ Please DON'T confuse that with the Thalmanns animation system from
  Montreal. These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]

  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives
  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in
  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional
  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS
  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary
  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-
  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer
  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the
  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision
  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in
  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire
  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize
  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data
  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value
  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time
  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of
  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of
  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other 
  palettes can be generated.


Supported functions include such niceties as the following:

o  image & image: + - / * interpolation
o  image & constant: + - / *
o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,
   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.
o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or
   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.
o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,
   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp
   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,
   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to
   any specified angle.
o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan
   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to
   region target mean, median, or modal value.
o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,
   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.
o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of
   region of an image.
o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot
   keyword values for a set of images.
o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,
   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower
   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive
   background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical
   aperture shape to image isophotes. 
o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot
   of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`
   centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,
   change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and
   adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function
   or histogram equalization.
o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for
   registration.
o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or
   2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers
   can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,
   point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and
   quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights
   or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass
   back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)
   to file or printer.  Change to user specified coordinate system.
o  Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to
   HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.)
o  Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly?  Does 
short-term use of the drug ever produce long-term side-effects after
the use of the drug?  My grandmother recently had to be hospitalized
and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks.  Although the
drug has been terminated, she has changed from a perky, slightly
senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone
and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance.  It
seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the
course of just one and one-half months.  I have to believe that the
combination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in part
catalysts for this.  Any comments?

then you can tear up their quote and stuff it in the prepaid return

I heard a short blurb on the news yesterday about an herb called feverfew (?)
that some say is good for preventing migraines. I think the news said there
were two double-blind studies that found this effective.

Does anyone know about these studies? Or have experience with feverfew?
I'm skeptical, but open to trying it if I can find out more about this.
What is feverfew, and how much would you take to prevent migraines (if 
this is a good idea, that is)? Are there any known risks or side effects
of feverfew?

               Rates of Cesarean Delivery -- United States, 1991
               =================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(15)   DATE: Apr 23, 1993

     Cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly 1 million of the 
approximately 4 million annual deliveries in the United States since 1986 
(Table 1). The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among 
21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This 
report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital 
Discharge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years. 
     Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been 
collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC's National Center 
for Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were 
abstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 
participating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior 
cesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national 
estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged 
after delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were 
calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from 
national vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of 
cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based 
solely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at 
the 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value 
of 1.96. 
     In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as 
in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean 
rate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no 
previous cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. 
In 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) 
higher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast 
(22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years 
than for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or 
government hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger 
hospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other 
private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of 
payment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. 
     Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women 
increased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained 
the same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, 
essentially the same as the 23.5 observed. 
     Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1
Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993

estimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated 
338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary 
cesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been 
performed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean 
delivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991, 
35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., 
failure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal 
distress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. 
     The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In 
comparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, 
and for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC 
deliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 
days). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for 
primary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and 
non-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. 

Reported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center 
for Health Statistics, CDC. 

Editorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from 
1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates 
have been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that 
maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because 
cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of 
childbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the 
overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary 
cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). 
     Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections 
-- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries 
than for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for 
cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in 
1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and 
$4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes 
$611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean 
rate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number 
of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), 
resulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital 
charges. 
     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may 
impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean 
delivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women 
offered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). 
Of women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) 
--a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely 
offered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which

national data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) 
was 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all 
women who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was 
attempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the 
VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary 
rate. 
     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by 
applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean 
delivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review 
process (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates 
include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing 
reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of 
physician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public 
awareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, 
which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean 
delivery (4).

         Malaria Among U.S. Embassy Personnel -- Kampala, Uganda, 1992
         =============================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(15)   DATE: Apr 23, 1993

     The treatment and prevention of malaria in Africa has become a 
challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance. 
Although the risk of acquiring malaria for U.S. citizens and their dependents 
stationed overseas generally has been low, this risk varies substantially and 
unpredictably. During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of 
State (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases 
among official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the 
health records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27 
cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June 
1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and 
CDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and 
identify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This 
report summarizes the results of the investigation. 
     Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were 
available for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if 
the slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide-
confirmed as having malaria. 
     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to 
obtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria 
chemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets 
and insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long 
sleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey, 
128 (82%) responded. 
     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in 
Kampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less 
than or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 
years (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk 
RR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the 
cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years, 
compared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the 
Kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for 
malaria. 
     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who 
participated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine 
alone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were 
not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly 
lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 
9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 
24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported 
side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. 
     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5
Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993

all or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely 
used bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was 
also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening 
(0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; 
upper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with 
failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the 
evening. 
     As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel 
the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis 
regimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection 
measures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to 
provide window and door screens for all personnel.

Editorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was 
attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis 
regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased 
malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan 
Africa. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and 
continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in 
malaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for 
short-term travelers to such areas. 
     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most 
other areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas 
(e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In 
Africa, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in 
preventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and 
well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk 
for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis 
(e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 
users 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, 
gastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for 
other antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). 
     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need 
for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen 
(3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense 
chloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for 
persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil 
is an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be 
used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. 
falciparum has not been reported.

      FDA Approval of Use of a New Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine and a
       Combined Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis and Haemophilus b Conjugate
                       Vaccine for Infants and Children
      ==================================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(15)   DATE: Apr 23, 1993

     Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines have been 
recommended for use in infants since 1990, and their routine use in infant 
vaccination has contributed to the substantial decline in the incidence of Hib 
disease in the United States (1-3). Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and 
pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the 
United States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than 
90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these 
organisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely 
recommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined 
vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate 
injections. 
     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products 
for vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b 
conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for 
vaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus 
toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine 
(TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in 
vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease. 

                               ActHIB Trademark 

     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate 
vaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), 
manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB 
Trademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This 
vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary 
vaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously 
unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months 
apart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one 
dose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all 
children. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive 
a single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving 
a primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, 
and 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b 
polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to 
that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed 
Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in 
prospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early 
because of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines

for use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease 
were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and 
other studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to 
that of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark 
     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus 
toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate 
vaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl 
River, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL 
Registered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and 
Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis 
Biologics, Inc. Rochester, New York). 
     This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years 
for protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when 
indications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate 
vaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody 
responses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark 
is expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, 
and pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other 
DTP and Haemophilus b vaccines. 
     The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that 
all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b 
conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12-
15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose 
primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, 
4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A 
complete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and 
TETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed.

                                 HIV Infection

                             NIDR Research Digest
                             written by Jody Dove
                                  March 1993
                     National Institute of Dental Research

     At the Second International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV 
Infection, held January 31-February 3 in San Francisco, participants explored 
issues related to the epidemiology, basic molecular virology, mucosal 
immunology, and oral clinical presentations of HIV infection. 
     The workshop was organized by Dr. John Greenspan and Dr. Deborah 
Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University of 
California, San Francisco.  An international steering committee and scientific 
program committee provided guidance. 
     The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including 
Asia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United 
States and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National 
Institute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, 
and the Procter and Gamble Company. 
     Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics, 
professional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision 
of oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and 
mucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and 
women's issues. 

                                Recommendations

     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association 
between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to 
establish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for 
more effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology 
studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral 
lesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions. 

                                 Epidemiology

     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV 
Infection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has

radically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely 
in homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.  
Today, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in 
children and adolescents. 
     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a 
major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.  
Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more 
are appearing all the time. 
     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions 
such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore 
the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression 
and prognosis. 

                            Social/political Issues

     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection 
focused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for 
indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health 
care delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public 
about what AIDS is, and how it is acquired. 

                          Saliva and Salivary Glands

     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory 
activity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary 
secretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular 
secretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid 
secretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible 
for salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect 
of saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both 
promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) 
direct effects on the virus or target cells. 
     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease

     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With 
early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV-
infected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV from 
mother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother's 
sero-status is known prior to giving birth.

     Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and 
gingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection.  Recommendations made at 
the workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement of 
diagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration 
of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy. 

                       Occupational and Treatment Issues

     Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals 
and treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command 
considerable attention.  Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit 
of HIV testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection 
and the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the 
treatment of HIV-infected patients. 
     Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on 
the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less.  
Proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence 
Company in late 1993.

My ENT doctor recommended surgery to fix my sinuses.  I have a very deviated
nasal septum (probably the result at least partially from several fractures).
One side has approximately 10-15% of normal flow.  Of course I have known this
for years but recently discovered that I suffer from chronic sinus infection,
discovered during an MRI after a severe migraine.  A CT scan subsequently 
confirmed the problems in the sinuses.

He wants to do endoscopic sinus surgery on the ethmoid, maxillary, frontal,
and sphenoid, along with nasal septoplasty.

He explained the procedure, and the risks.  What I would like to know is if
there is anyone out there who can tell me ""I had this surgery, and it helped
me""?

(I've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didn't
really help them).

I am a moderately severe asthmatic.  ENT doc says large percentage see some
relief of their asthma after sinus surgery.  Also he said it is not unheard of
that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved.

I am 42.

Any relevant information is appreciated.

Subject: Please Help: Point in concave Polyhedra
Lines: 43

Dear Netters:


I am looking for C source code to test if a 3D point lies within a

concave polyhadra. I have read a few articles about this and know

that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Both


ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there exists

public domain source code for this.

    Another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting

which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces

consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used
(M. Tamminen, et. al., 1984. ""Ray-casting and block model conversion
using a spatial index"". Computer-Aided-Designs. 4, 1984, 60-65).
But the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their
normal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ?
I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure their
normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed
this is already the case.


   I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden
line removal. It says ""if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing

toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra..."". Again how to make
sure ?


   Any pointers are welcome ?

Unfortonately, that truly is about the best summation of the research
that there is.  Advantages stated of circumcison included probably
prevention of penile cancer, (which, interestingly, occurs mostly in men
whose personal hygiene is exceptionally poor), simplicity of personal
hygiene, prevention of urinary tract infections, and prevention of
a unretractible foreskin,  Disadvantages include infection from the 
procedure, pain, etc.  I apologize; I am trying to pull this off
the top of my head.  I will post what I discovered in research; I did
a paper on the topic in my research class in Nursing school.
It really is a decision that is up to the parents.  Some parents use
the reasoning that they will ""look like Daddy"" and like their friends
as justification.  There is nothing wrong with this; just be sure it is
what you want to do, since it is rather difficult to uncircumcise
a male, although a major surgical procedure exists.

As long as your membranes have not broken and you have not had any
problems with your pregnancy, it should be OK to sit in a tub of water.
HOWEVER, I WOULD RECOMMEND USING YOUR OWN BATHTUB IN YOUR OWN HOME!
It is nearly impossible to guarantee the cleanliness and safety of ""public""
hot tubs.  A nice warm bath can be very relaxing, especially if your back
is killing you!  And it would possibly be advisable to avoid bubble bath
soap , esp. if you are prone to yeast infection.

Hope these tips help you some.

Primarily milage.  Gas is much more expensive, so people are very
concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  This,
along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with
smaller engines.  These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh
well with an automatic.  So, having engines that don't work well with
autos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has a
manual.

(Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals.  If you've got the
money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to
drive through the slushbox.)

As automatics become more efficient, the ""bigotry"" is probably
reduced.  Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are
cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  So there
aren't compelling reasons to go automatic.

You know, I'm a Ford fan, I must say, so I'm looking forward to the next
Mustang.  I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable
than the Camaro is now.  You know, that's MHO.  

The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality,
just the philosophy.  It used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  GM is
barely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that
can only be made up in time.  STSs still come off the assembly line
with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments;
it's those 75 year old plants.  And the latest GM products still come
with the standard equipment RattleDash (tm).  But like I said, they're
getting better and making the move in the right direction.

They beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really only
in words.  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the
end of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part
since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there.  I wouldn't
press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it.
Besides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway.

I do not put much stock in the mag rags' ""inside"" information, or even
Ford rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was
finally disclosed in it's entirety.  ""Inside"" information had the
Taurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I wouldn't look
for a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself
if you do.  There's a lot of potential.  Ford hasn't released a new
car without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been
brewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those
modular V8's are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and
competition, don't rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do.
And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,
who really knows what it'll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it.
Highly.

The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car.  It attracts
way more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it's heritage
is more embedded in the general public.  Don't lie to yourself and
believe Ford will forfeit that.

I submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit
defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know,
intelligent, critical spews like, ""The Mustang bites, man!""  Some of
you are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro
will be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the
differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.
The Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its
cab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still
reaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to
the driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while
the Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.
Both will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will be
no clear winner.

Unless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.  You don't seriously believe
that it was designed for the Mark VIII only, do you?

It sounds as though you might want to try a product such as ""super-glue"".
The active ingredient is cynoacrylate, the same compound used to reconstruct
bones.  I have successfully used superglue for a number of procedures on many
different species of animal. If you are simply trying to adhear something
to bone for several months, this would be ideal. It bonds almost immediatly,
is resistant to infection, and is non-irritating to surrounding tissue.

   This idea, that the Reformers somehow were the first to bring the
Bible to the people in their own language, is a myth.  Many vernacular
translations of the Bible existed long before the Reformation.  The
Vulgate Bible, which is still the official version of the Bible for the
Catholic Church, was itself a translation in the common (i.e. vulgar ==
vulgate) tongue of its day, Latin, and had existed for about a millenium
before the Reformation.

   It might also be noted that the printing press was not even invented
until the same century as that in which the Reformation occurred.

I have had my Probe looked at twice by my local dealer (where I purchased
the car) ... the first time, they made this problem worse.  The second time,
after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford-probe mailing
list (they said they didn't know of the bulletin), they adjusted the window and

about notifying the National Traffic Safety group as well as Ford.  Those little

Well, I guess that's good in a way, but in a way it's bad.  When someone
hears that kind of horn, they expect to see a big American car.  They may
not associate the sound with a small ""jap car"" style car (like the Probe is).

I have always been a 5-speed guy.  Almost every car I've ever owned has been
a 5-speed.  Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I
(knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  But it is a pretty
high-tech automatic.  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with
torque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, I'm getting 35 mpg on the
highway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I 
probably made that sentence up).  :-)     Around town the mileage has been
around 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   Of course it doesn't have the
""control"" of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns out
to be very convenient.  It's nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and
drive at the same time (although that, too, is illegal here in

>>No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)

look like they're designed for performance (ie rather wide, shallow
tread, etc), so they probably won't last as long.  But the car handles
very very very well.  It sticks to the road like glue, even on a rough
surface.

Definitely.  Ford/Mazda did a very very nice job on this one.  The
car has a ""much more expensive than it actually is"" look and feel to it.

Having driven an 89 Probe for 4 years, I find the 93 suspension ""interesting"".
The car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm
ride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road.  Yet
the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads.  You Hear and
feel the bumps, yet the car retains its posture very well.

Well I wouldn't encourage passenger-carrying in the Probe unless the
person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash.  As
mentioned in the Consumer Reports write-ups, ""consider the back seat
as a parcel shelf"".  No biggie to me though (if it had been, I'd not
have bought the car!  (but it's definitely not a family car)).

A/C is a MUST on any Probe from 89 - 93.  The 93 in particular sends out
a REAL BLAST of cool air when the AC is on MAX.  That ""lots of glass"" you
mentioned is what gives the car the ""very good visibility"" reports you
see in all the write-ups.  Most ""sports/sporty"" cars don't have that
good visibility.

The complaints I've heard re: exhaust system (on 93's) have been on 
the GT.  Of course being a different engine, that is a differeent 
exhaust system.

I was one of those with an 89 who qualified for the free replacement.
Since I had already replaced the muffler when I received the notice, 
I was/am due a refund from Ford.  I applied in February and am Still

Yes.  I was pretty amazed when I had my car in for some touch-up
adjustments this past week, and they had to keep it overnight (too busy
for them to get to it) and they offered to pay for a rental).  They 
did make me pay for taxes and insurance though :-(

I have to agree that they seem to have some QC problesm.  But I seriously

Who is Ram Das?

According to his brochures, he is a.k.a. Richard Alpert, PhD, and is
somehow associated with the:

  Seva Foundation
  8 N. San Pedro Road
  San Rafael, CA  94903

and the:
  Hanuman Foundation 
  524 San Anselmo Ave #203
  San Anselmo, CA  94960

He speaks publically on such topics as ""Consciousness & Current
Events,"" and has written some books and recorded some tapes on 
similar subjects.  

Why do I care?  My wife wants to go to one of his lectures.  When
I asked why, she said Ram Das was ""the greatest spiritual leader
of our time!""

Several years ago my wife got involved with a religious cult, and
we went through 9 months of hell that almost ended our marriage 
before she quit.  Let's just say I'm concerned about this Ram Das
and her interest, especially so with the recent religious cult
events from Texas.  I need information - solid and real - so I 
know what I'm dealing with.

If you have any information about Ram Das or the organizations 
shown above, I would be very interested in your correspondence.
Please reply via e-mail to me at:  scott%hpsdde@SDD.HP.COM

Thank you!

[The dictionary of cults that I use classifies this as ""new age"", with
a basically Hindu orientation.  The headquarters is (or was when this
was written) at that Lama Foundation, which they identify as a ""New
Age Commune"" in San Cristobel, New Mexico.  For information you might
read Alpert's books, which they list as ""Be Here Now"" (an
autobiography), ""The Only Dance There is"", and ""Grist for the Mill"".
It is dealt with briefly in a citation given as ""Larson, New Book, pp
339-41"". I assume this is Bob Larson, ""Larson's New Book of Cults"".
I'd warn you however that the whole approach to the ""new age"" is
controversial.  Sources such as the reference book I used, as well as
Bob Larson, believe in a Satanic new age conspiracy, which some regard
as hysterical.  However at the very least, it seems clear that this is
not a Christian group.  --clh]

Food products can get through breast milk and cause allergies in the
young.  Since the son is allergic it would be best not to go to
bottle feedings, but rather eliminate foods from mother's diet.  Your
pediatrician should be able to give you a list of foods to avoid.

The bacteria in your gut are important.  But colonic flushes are not the 
way to improve gut function.  Each person has almost a unique mix of 
bacteria in his/her gut.  Diet affects this mix as does the use of 
antibiotics.  A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in 
your gut than is colonic flushes.  Cross contamination has been a real 
problem in some of the outfits that do this ""treatment"" since the equipment 
is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient ""treatments"".
Dental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I've 
picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his 
instruments(more clostly but much safer).  Full sterile technique is 
also used just like that practiced in an OR(mask, gloves and gowns worn and 
disposed of between patients).  Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than 
the standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket.  His much 
higher fees do not drive away patients.

I can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to 
this colonic flush procedure.  For very little, if any benefit, you 
subject yourself to hepatitis, cholera, parasitic disease and even HIV.
Just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment?
Could they be having GI distress?  Could this distress be due to a 
pathogenic organism?  Could I get this organism if the equipment is not 
cleaned properly between patients?  Do I really want to take this risk?
Food for thought.

There's always the old switcheroo.

My brother works at a dialysis clinic.  They were interviewing 
candidates for a technician job (mainly electronics tech), and a
urine screen was part of the interview.  The bathroom was across
the hall from a lab.  One candidate managed to switch his urine
sample with one he grabbed from the lab.  (No one was in it at
the time.)

Most inner-city dialysis patients have quite a few medical problems,
so it was immediately obvious what had happened.  My brother 
fleetingly considered telling the candidate, ""I'm sorry but you
are very ill and need medical attention immediately.""  They offered
him another *well-monitored* chance and he declined.

Still its amazing in Germany you can have cars traveling 155 mph and 65 mph

This is ridiculous, and your doctor sounds like a nut, if what is
reported here is what the doctor actually said.  If your wife's
pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic, she'll
need insulin replacement.  That doesn't mean she's ""dependent"" on
insulin, anymore than she was beforehand--if her body doesn't make
enough, she'll have to get it elsewhere.  Oral thyroid replacement
hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism, and
it's really the only effective therapy available anyway.  Plus, it's
cheap.  Taking thyroid hormone when it isn't needed does cause your
thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone, but that's a
_feature_, not a _bug_, and it's irrelevant in any case in the face of
hypothyroidism, because her problem that her gland isn't producing
enough.  There isn't a clinical phenomenon of ""thyroid insufficiency""
caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone
analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of
prolonged administration of corticosteroids, so there should be no
worry about inappropriately ""suppressing"" the thyroid gland.

Dear fellow Christians,  

	I had a dinner last night with a bible study group which      
I am in. We had a discussion about the difference between Christianity
and Islam. And I was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher
said that Mohammad was indeed a prophet but of Satan. I said, ""What??""
I did not believe that, because I have some moslem friends who are
so kind and  nice, even sometimes I feel I wish I could be like them
(in my point of view, they don't sin as much as I do). How come if they
were under Satan, they could have such personalities. 

To tell you the truth, I don't know much about Islam.
But I know that they believe in God, they believe in the day of
judgement.
	
	Now I'm  asking you what your opinions about Islam and 
its teaching. 

IMPORTANT : I do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not.
	    I do not want to discuss about politic related to Islam.

P.S: I post this in bit.listserv.christia, soc.religion.christian,
     and bit.listserv.catholic.

	TORSINA@ENUXHB.EAS.ASU.EDU	   

[Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a
discussion of Islam, since there's a group for that.  But I suspect
the point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam.
Indeed it's going to be impossible to see what he was getting at
within your groundrules, since the question of whether non-Christians
are saved is at the heart of it.

The classic Christian view, which I think most people believed until
the last century or so, was that Christianity (and of course Judaism)
was the only religion founded by God, and that all other religions
worshipped false gods, and came from Satan.  This is more or less a
corollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians (and
possibly Jews) will be saved.  This need not mean that there's no
truth in any other religion, nor that all of their members are
intentionally Satanic.  After all, in order to be an effective snare,
Satanic alternatives would have to be attractive.  Thus they might
contain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights.  They would
be missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through Christ.
If this is the background of your teacher's remarks -- and I suspect
it is -- that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily
relevant.  The point is not that there's anything intrinsically wrong
with it.  It may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitioners
may all be wonderful people.  But if salvation requires being a
follower of Christ, it could still be a Satanic invention.

This is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant position.
Christianity says that salvation isn't a matter of being kind and
nice.  Those are good things, and we should encourage them.  But no
one is able to do them enough to be saved.  Salvation requires Christ.
(Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant terms.  There's a
Catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but in
different terms.)  A religion may be quite attractive in all visible
ways.  But if it doesn't have Christ, it's like a diet that consists
of food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing some
essential food element so that you end up dying.

Let me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position.
What I'm trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues.  Indeed it is
now relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all other
religions are Satanic.  Most Christians regard such beliefs as an
unfortunate vestige of the past.  This is part of a general move
within Christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental
God.  Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allow
anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell, and they
find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at
work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive
alternatives to Christianity.  Whether there is actually a sound basis
for the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves.

The following was published in the May 15th Rocky Mountain News.  I
guess I have some REAL ethical problems with the practices at this

understand that this is not an honest way to proceed.  Unfortunately,
this is becoming more typical of congregations as the Second Coming is
perceived to approach.

Baptisms draw parents' ire -- Children at church carnival in Springs
told they'd be killed by bee stings if they didn't submit to religious
rite.

By Dick Foster -- Rocky Mountain News Southern Bureau

Colorado Springs -- Outraged parents say their children were lured to
a church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a
Baptist minister.

Doxens of children, some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied by
their parents, thought they were going to a carnival at the
Cornerstone Baptist Church, where there would be a big water fight,
free balloons, squirt guns and candy.

Before that May 1 carnival was over, however, children were whisked
into a room for religious instruction and told they should be
baptized.  In many cases they consented, although they or their
families are not of the Baptist faith.

The baptisms by the church have angered many parents, including
Paulette Lamontagne, a Methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girls
who were baptized without her knowledge or consent.

'My understnading was they were going to a carnival.  I feel that's a
false pretense,' said Lamontagne.  Her daughters said the minister
told them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not
baptized.

Cornerstone church officials defended their actions.

'We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commanded
us to baptize converts.  No one can show me one passage in the Bible
where it says that parental permission is required before a child is
baptized,' said Dan Irwin, associate pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist
Church.

Church officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized
because 'they didn't ask,' Irwin said.

Many other parents also felt they were simply sending their children
to a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who were
members of the Cornerstone Church.

Police said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the
children, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action.

-------------------------------------------
Aren't these the same behaviors we condemn
in the Hari Krishnas and other cults?

[I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account
mentions.  First, I'm not entirely sure that parental consent is
absolutely required.  This would be extremely difficult, because of
the clear commandment to obey parents.  But if an older child insisted
on being baptized without their parents' consent, I might be willing
to do it.  However this would be a serious step, and would warrant
much careful discussion.  The problem I find here is not so much
parental consent as that there was nobody's consent.  Whether you
believe in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the sign
of entry into a Christian community.  If there isn't a commitment from
*somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part of
the Church, the baptism appears to be a lie.  Furthermore, it is
likely to raise serious practical problems.  What if the child is from
a baptist tradition?  Normally when he reaches the age of decision, he
would be expected to make a decision and be baptized.  But he already
has been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church.  So does he get
rebaptized?  Neither answer is really very good.  If not, he's being
robbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith.

No disagreement at all that there is a VERY serious struggle going on.
But Jesus more typically uses consequences as a threat.  That's quite
different from Hell Classic (TM). :-) Jesus doesn't sound like the
usual hell-fire type of preacher.  He attracts people through what he
does. And the stongest example in Jesus preaching is in the parable of 
Lazarus and Dives, which is a parable!  In any case, my point is that
a fear-based response to Christ is not a freeing, life-affirming choice
and isn't Good News in a meaningful sense.  There are plenty of good 
reasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal 
hell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between 
God and the Disloyal Opposition.  A faith based in fear is not built
on Rock, as we should found our faith, but on ice.  If the fear were
removed, there would BE no foundation.  

That's basically why it matters to me.  I think we have many Christians 
that DON'T have a solid basis for relating to the living Incarnate God.
I cannot be fully open to the working of God in and through my life if
my response to God is motivated on fear.

That depends on how this verse is read.  There are at least two
meanings of the word ""once"".  1) only one time, and 2) at some
other time (i.e. once upon a time).  Note that in the previous
verse, the word ""once"" is used with the second meaning, and also
in the following verse, ""once"" is again used with the second meaning.
The Greek, I am sure, uses different words for each of the two meanings
for the English word ""once"".  I am not a Greek scholar, but I'm sure
someone here can verify which Greek word is used here for this meaning.
If the second meaning is being used, that verse can be interpreted as:

  - for it was once given for men to die (beginning with Adam), but 
    after this [gift of atonement offered by Jesus Christ] the judgement
    [is made available], for now there is no longer death, but life
    with Christ.

It seems to me you've offered a circular refutation of Moss's organization. Who
has shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable? Could
it be those 'regulatory' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing
to be operating with *major* vested interests. Whether one believes that these
vested interests are real or not, or whether or not they actually shape medical
research is a seperate argument. If one sees a possibility, however, that these
interests exist, then the 'fact' that some of the information put out by PAC
has been refuted by the medical industry doesn't hold much weight.

As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons, the fact that the NIH didn't
find them effective doesn't make much sense here. Of course they didn't! I
tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after
being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon. They are fighting
like hell to keep that clinic open, and they credit his treatment with their
survival. Anyone who looks at the NIH's record for investigation of 'alterna-

ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless.

The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this
OTC medication.  A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater
can cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are
potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall
correctly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses
involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which
is a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with
sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic
glutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts
attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic
necrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the
delay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver
damage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.

As to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams
of acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probably
cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.

Actually the company, and the product was ROVAC - which stood for
ROTary Air Conditioning..it used a rotary compressor with what

The negatives were mostly that it was about 5-10% less efficient than

I certainly agree with the last paragraph.  Also, Jesus;s statements on
hell can be treated as totally symbolic, allegorical or as parables, as
was much of his other teaching.  There's more than enough hell here on earth
that we are freed from by following Jesus that the rest just doesn't mattter

God offers.  Eternal life begins for us now and we do not wait to start

MY REPLY...
(1) When I first became a Christian, I entered into the Word/Faith
    movement.  It was easy.  I wasn't grounded in the Word of God and sound
    doctrine.  When I visited Christian book stores, the cheapest books I
    could find to buy were the .50 and $1.00 books by Hagin and others.
    Consequently, I began receiving Hagin's monthly magazine (and they
    still send it to me), and also Copeland's (also, still sent to me).
    It wasn't until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called _Hyper Faith:
    The New Gnosticism_ that I began to realize the teachings I were
    partaking of were error.  I started reading the Bible more and studying
    more.  Sure enough, Jimmy was right in many points.  As part of my
    experience, I am alerting Christians, particularly new Christians, that
    these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in
    Acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with Scripture!
 
(2) My brother in law was involved in a Word/Faith ""cult"" in my area - it's
    leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn.  Rather then going into
    much detail about this, suffice it to say he was deceived, mistreated, and

(3) The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been
    a `follower' of Copeland for 15 years.  He has thousands of tapes by the

(4) The leader of the Women's Group at my church is a Benny Hinn `fan'.
    Recently, I found that she has been lending _Good Morning, Holy Spirit_ to
    women in the church.  That prompted my quotes in Sunday School, as well as
    my lending CIC to people in the church.
 
I'm well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and
have an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies.
What heresies?
    A. Jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil, and became
        one with him.
    B. Jesus' death on the cross wasn't enough to atone.
    C. Jesus was dragged to hell after His death, was beat and abused by
        Satan and demons, thus finishing our atonement.  Satan was ruling
        over Him there.
    D. Jesus was `born-again' in hell.
    E. Jesus died spiritually, lost His divinity, and reassumed it after
        the resurrection.
    F. We are gods.
 
These are heresies.  Documentation will be provided re: these teachings
upon request.

MY REPLY...
Why do you call it ""heresy hunting""?  ""Hunting"" implies it isn't readily
accessible or available.  This movement is the fastest growing movement in
Christendom.  Hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets.  Hinn has sold
more books in the last couple of years than Swindoll and Dobson combined.  Fred
Price has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the USA.  Doesn't
sound like much ""hunting"" is needed.
 
It is Scriptural to expose doctrinal error.  I gave some verses to you before.
More can be given.  Most of the epistles were written due to error (doctrinal,
practical) in the churches.  The early church had numerous councils to expose
error and heresy.  It's not a new thing.  Remember Luther?

of Christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried
about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning
craftiness of deceitful plotting....
 
Disunity, contrary to popular opinion, isn't caused by exposing error; it's
caused by error.

MY REPLY...
Most scholars believe Paul wrote 2 Timothy last.  Let's examine his admonitions
to Tim to ascertain how mellow he had become...
 
2TI 1:13-15 Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me,
in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. That good thing which was
committed to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. This you know, that
all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and
Hermogenes.
 
2TI 2:15-18 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does
not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profane
and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. And their
message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, who
have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already
past; and they overthrow the faith of some.
 
2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all,
able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if
God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and
that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having
been taken captive by him to do his will.
 
2TI 3:6-9 For of this sort are those who creep into households and make
captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,
always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as
Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of
corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; but they will progress no
further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.
 
2TI 3:12-17 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer
persecution. But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving
and being deceived. But you must continue in the things which you have learned
and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from
childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise
for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by
inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be
complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.
 
2TI 4:2-5 Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince,
rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. For the time will come
when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires,
because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and
they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.
But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an
evangelist, fulfill your ministry.

Please explain.
 
Zane...
""Secondly, I suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships -
which in the strict Scriptural sense is the local city-church.""
 
MY REPLY...
If heresy was not being propagated over the mass media, then it may not be
needed to go mass media with the exposure.  Unfortunately, heresy is being
taught not just in Copeland's church or Hagin's or Hinn's or Price's, but all
over the radio, in print, etc.  No pastor or church leader knows what materials
the sheep are feeding on outside the church.  It's imperative that leadership
be made aware of this, and CIC does just that.
 
Also, let's examine a passage of Scripture...
* EPH 4:11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some
evangelists, and some pastors and teachers,
* EPH 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the
edifying of the body of Christ,
 
These ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for one
individual church, but for ""the body of Christ"".
Paul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message.  He was also
a teacher -
1CO 4:17 For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and
faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach
everywhere in every church.
1CO 7:17 But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each
one, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches.
 
Also -
1CO 12:28 And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second
prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, varieties of tongues.
 
* EPH 4:13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of
the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness
of Christ;
 
Notice that the ""Five-Fold"" ministries are going to be around ""till"" the church
is in ""unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect
man"".  This, I believe will not occur fully until the Lord Jesus returns (see
1Cor. 13:9-12).  But God wants the body to continue on maturing.  What hinders
maturity and unity of the body?
 
* EPH 4:14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried
about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning
craftiness of deceitful plotting,
 
It's clear that false doctrine, integrated into the church ""by the trickery of
men"" causes (1) disunity [the thing we are striving for] and (2) spiritual
immaturity - the church continues in spiritual childhood when Christians are
""tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine"".
 
The ""Five -Fold"" ministry, of which there does not appear to be clear
Scriptural denominational boundaries (""pastors"" appear responsible for their
individual flock), is to deal with these doctrines (when necessary) in their
struggle to equip the body.
 
All believers are called to do this to a degree...
JUD 1:3-4 Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our
common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend
earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. For
certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this
condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny
the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
Zane...
""If you'll notice, in Scripture the heresy hunters that went from Church to
Church and area to area, were the ""bad guys"" and they went after the ""good guy""
namely Paul - who they considered to be the arch heretic.""
 
MY REPLY...
They were themselves heretics trying to discredit Paul who was preaching
contrary to what they taught!

Well, yeah, but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encode
rectangular bitmaps.  And the others are hardly trouble free.  I hear that
it is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.

The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful
options, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is that
rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently
in all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on
all machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared
to do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --
again, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored
by pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I also
note that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably
compresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that
none of the FAX formats are really useful.

What's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,
e.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have
provided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses
bytes rather than pixels.

But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register
proprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.
This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably
read all incoming TIFF files.  Some standard.

	For a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful
when I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also
pretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of
bedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I
will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because
I feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I
went to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.

	Anyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to
get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant;
but he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So
I used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly
and felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually
felt refreshed the next morning.

	So,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and
experimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am
presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The
antihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought
some generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't
notice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about
1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research
seems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest
sedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic
form of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good
dosage level to try.

	For other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have
an allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry
eyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did
guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some
changes in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I
went back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements)

	Anyway,  I am looking for advice for the use of
antihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use
(Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by
millions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to be
a serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good,
whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have
tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff,  and that also seems to
lower sleep quality,  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some
kind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also,  I would be interested in
any other advice for helping my problem.  (Although I've already tried
many of the non-pharmacological solutions)

THE diarrhea problem?  WHAT diarrhea problem?  First, candidal overgrowth is
not a frequent problem during antibiotic therapy, and not all cases of
antibiotic-related diarrhea have anything to do with candida.  But a case
of vaginal candidiasis or oral thrush after antibiotic therapy isn't going

Oh, really?  Where'd you come up with this?  You know, it's really
appalling to see you try to comment authoritatively on clinical matters

Bobbing for citations in the research literature isn't medicine.

Larry -

Thanks for the reply, but this isn't quite the same thing.  Like I said before, 
I can understand why non-Christians would be denied *access* to holy 
ceremonies, but the ceremony itself (communion) was not secret.  In fact, all 
four gospels record the first ""breaking of the bread"" in some detail.  
Communion was a fellowship meal, and it was (and still should be, in my 
opinion) inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of 
the Body of Christ.  The fact that unbelievers, denied access to these communal 
meals, began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during 
communion does not by any means imply that the early Christians were in fact 
hiding shameful things from the general public.  In fact, I think if you read 
some of the early church fathers, you will find that they were not at all 
bashful about describing what went on during communion.  That's why it seems 
funny to me when Mormons, who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st 
century Christianity, insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they 
are ""too sacred.""

[Actually, that's not quite the case.  John omits the central elements
of the Last Supper.  His Gospel is full of symbolism of bread and
wine.  But the actual story isn't there.  Some people think he has
omitted some of the details because they were not talked about in
public in his community.  There is also evidence that some aspects of
baptismal practice were kept secret. See Morton Smith's ""Secret
Gospel"" -- I don't agree with his lurid speculations on what the
secret practices actually were, but there does seem to be some
evidence that Mark omitted certain details because they were 
inappropriate for publication.  --clh]

More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics
workstations, so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the
E&S Freedom.


Here is the text of a Denali vs. E&S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates.

------

Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics
subsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use
a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both
have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of
pixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly
in performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have 
similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market
penetration.

There remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and
E&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end
developer's dream system with plenty of performance potential and
flexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to
sixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at
a higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom
systems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that
support a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom
design treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing
developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose
applications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and
video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note
that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not
require an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,
however, will remain much more flexible.

The KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.
Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end
Freedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price
points.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because
it uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting
in better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide
strong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that
not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's
configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase
geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade
them separately as needed.

Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at
workstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive
VGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide
this capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation
of textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher
qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali
provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.
Aside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism
for texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics
data storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation
modules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels
to obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking
texturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable
solution.

Hope this helps,

There are several different types of Thyroid diseases which would cause
a hypothyroid condition (reduction in the output of the thyroid, mainly
thyroxin). Except for ones caused by infections, the treatment is
generally thyroxin pills. Hypothyroid conditions caused by infections
usually disappear when the infection does...this doesn't sound like the
case with your wife.
Thyroxin orally does ""shut down the thyroid"" through a feedback loop
involving the pituitary (I believe). The pituitary ""thinks"" that the
correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn't have to
tell the thyroid to produce more. This process is reversable! I have
Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition) and was on thyroxin
for approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pills
for 6 wks. When I was retested for thyroxin levels, they were normal.
I still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear.
The pills are safe and have very few side-affects (& those mostly at
beginning of treatment). Having a baby might be a problem and would at
least require closer monitoring of hormone levels.
Thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness, coldness,
and weight gain. There is also water retention (possibly around heart),
changes in vision, and coarser hair and skin among other things.

I am not a doctor, so I'm sure I mistated something, but the important
thing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they
aren't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body. Get a
second opinion from a good endocrinologist and have him/her explain
things in detail to you and your wife.

I am the original owner of the seats and the original poster. 
I take VERY serious offence in your statement. 
I see a lot of computers advertized on the net, and my friend just had been
releived of his machine = all the net-computer ads are for stolen computers?
Where did you learn logic?

As for the seats, they were replaced by a much harder (literally) Celica GTS
seats due to my back problem. That is why I had to reuse the MR2 brackets
and that's why the MR2 seats I sell are attached to Celica brackets.

Please in the future think before you make allegations like the above.

Paul mentions his ""thorn"" (SKOLOPS, actually a sharp stake) in 2
Corinthians 12:7-9

 + And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of
 + revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of
 + Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated. Three
 + times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me;
 + but he said to me, ""My grace is sufficient for you, for my
 + power is made perfectr in weakness.""

He does not explain what it was, but it need not have been a moral
problem.  One guess is that Paul had a disorder of the eyes. He
ordinarily dictated his letters, and then added a personal note and
his signature. At the end of the letter to the Galatians, he says,
""See, I am writing in large letters with my own hand,"" or else, ""See
what a long letter I have written with my own hand."" If the former
translation is adopted, it seems that Paul could not write in the
small script of a practiced writer, but needed to make his letters
larger, and this suggests eye problems. Again, he says to the
Galatians (4:13-15),

 + You know that it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached
 + the gospel to you at first; and although my condition was a trial
 + to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an
 + angel of God.... For I bear you witness that, if possible, you
 + would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.

Perhaps this last line means simply, ""You would have done anything
for me, not withholding your most precious possessions (your eyes).""
But in that case, we would expect some wording like, ""If I had
needed them."" ""If it were possible"" sounds as though the bodily
ailment was connected with his eyes.

William Barclay, in his volume on Acts, makes a more specific
suggestion.  Before Paul preached in the highlands of Galatia, he
had been preaching in the coastal areas of Asia Minor. If he had had
a malarial attack while there, a doctor would have advised him to
leave the low country and head for the hills. Malaria might well
have given him both severe headaches and blurred vision.

I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and
demented during hospital stays. In the examples I've seen, drugs were
definitely involved. 

My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the
hospital. He was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separate
medications. The family protested, but the doctors were adamant, telling
us that none of the drugs interact. They even took the attitude that, if
he was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! With
the help of an MD friend of the family, we had all his medication
discontinued. He had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drug.
Two days later, he was his old self again. I guess there aren't many
medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions.

I don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. It is an
aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. Docs seem to believe
that, because they have close control of you, it's quite all right to
take your bodily equilibria into their own hands. That control reduces
the chance that the patient will make a mistake, but health care
providers can make mistakes too, and mistakes can be deadly under those
circumstances. 

I grant you that sometimes there's no choice. Nevertheless, I suggest
you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discuss
it with an independent doc. Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL
at all. HALDOL may have been used validly, or it may have been
prescribed because OTHER medication confused her, and because the
hospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly.

Just my opinion,

I have some color gifs which I would like to archive in a much smaller
size using a grayscale palette of 16 shades. The quantization to 16 grays
introduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminated
by dithering. Up to now I have used XV to process the images, but now I
would like to automate the procedure.

The problem is that XV can't (I think) convert images automatically, and the
obvious alternative PNMPLUS (PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER) don't even get close to
XV's quality. PNMDITHER apparently dithers in RGB, even though the images
are in grayscale. The dithering routine in XV seems to use the natural image
colors for the dither. Is this or any similar routine available in the
public domain? If so, where?

I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing
3-D interactive applications what types of 3-D widgets you would
like to have in your applications.  

A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the 
application.  It may let you

- manipulate application data, the camera,
  3-D objects in the scene and so on, or
- view the status of the application or 3-D objects
  via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or
- do whatever I missed but you think is possible.

For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a
partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated.
A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The length
of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the
ruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation and
feedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between
the objects along its own axis.


Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction.  The information
I gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool.
Your help is very much appreciated.

I'll tell you all that I know about chromium.  But before I do, I want to 
get a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney 
stone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart 
disease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to 
encourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do 
most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from 
the truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to 
be ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.
Same thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have 
a problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you 
or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.
Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help 
you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment 
program(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When 
my wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin 
E will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, 
plan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet 
change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.
But let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation 
and another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as 
your little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a 
regular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her 
gynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even 
scheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for 
the biggest Hospital in Tulsa).

One more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses 
high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is 
absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have 
drug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is 
really blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and 
minerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't 
be right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a 
lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new 
Clinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab 
tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet 
changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you 
handle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,
I'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really 
don't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think 
that I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a 
few with an axe to grind.  That's life.

Chromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very 
important) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor
(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine 
and glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to 
form GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,
and black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is 
seen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral 
chelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest 
for all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has 
come up there several times as a ""fat burner"".  Chromium is among the least 
toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really 
do any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for 
chromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about 
30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many 
believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I 
can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in 
Type II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there 
also seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is 
bioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when 
chromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to 
Type II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and 
glucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is 
concerned

Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, 
this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little 
more interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin 
responsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity 
is impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular 
pressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with 
glaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. 
Nutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt 
people to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, 
just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless 
they have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often 
found in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the 
RBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would 
prompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to 
check out this possible chromium link to glucoma.

You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC 
chromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a 
RBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail 
analysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny 
business going on in these unregulated labs right now.

Here's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider 
chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is 
available(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they 
also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not 
routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change 
and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?
Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical 
response to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium 
supplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of 
CrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.

What's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight
(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then 
exercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most 
Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have 
a poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  
When he or she says, ""what in the world are you talking about"", just say, 
please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook 
and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose 
tolerance.  If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you 
very much.

When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection 
incidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest 
that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial 
because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and

Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care.

Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses 
mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(
new antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline 
with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.
Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression 
but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.

> -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
> term effects?

Yes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good 
bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects 
of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the 
medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects 
of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).
 
> -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
> normal, and what does one do about it?

Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my 
opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is 
normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many 
infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some 
physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection 
frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to 
result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the 
length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms 
associated with the infection.

> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?

There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong 
immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, 
vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this 
is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low 
and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune 
response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are 
distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of 
these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe 
infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A 
status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for 
vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five 
nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the 
others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.
But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the 
critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also 
be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a 
nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(
like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.
Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's 
what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves 
nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training 
needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good 
for getting general dietary advice from however.

hi all, i got several emails and a couple news replies and i guess i
shoulda went into more detail... Being my anxiety level is peaking and you
folks have no clue who I am I may as well post the specifics and see what
you people think regarding my previous post.
To recap i applied to 20 schools total, 16 of which were MD and 4 DO.

as it stands now i have had 13 rejects, 4 interviews( 2 MD and 2 DO), the
results of which are 2 waiting lists (1 MD and one DO)

3 schools i heard nothing from at all.

I have contacted all institutions other than the rejects and they have no
info whatsoever to tell me.

I have taken a good mix to apply to.. 2-3 top schools a bunch of middles
and a few ""safety""  (funny that most of my safety schools were the first
to reject me)

my index is at like a 3.5 mcats were R7 P9 B10 WQ and R7 P9 B11 WR
I couldnt get the damn reading score up... i never stuff like art
history, politics etc 

Ive done medical research at the undergrad level, done clinical lab work
for years now, but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience.

I cant think of what else i left out... but thats the summary. What
percent of people are usually called from the waiting lists on an average?
I felt that my interviews went quite well yet i dont have a firm
acceptance in my hand... anyone have any suggestions as to calm the
mailbox anxiety?  

If you premeds out there or med students have any questions or comments
for me feel free to send them down... Typing is a form of anti-anxiety
thereapy hehehehe :)

My wifes uncle was a 30+ level mason.  He let me look at some of the books
(which after his death his ""brothers"" came over and took from his greiving
widow before his body had even cooled).  Don't tell me you don't worship
Osiris.  You must not be past your 20th level.  You should read Wilkinson's
Egyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British
Masonry.  There is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black
mason.  I've talked with him, though much he likes to hide (""mystery""). 
Special handshakes and all.  When he first started trying to ""evangelize"" me,
he told me all kinds on special this, and special that.  Here is truely a
""mystery"" religion.  THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and
childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest
degree mason every learns of.

I haven't read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired
apologist (can't remember his name) on TV, didn't exactly come to this same
conclusion.  

""Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally
represented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented
very frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity
-i.e. as a child in his mother's arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, 'the
son, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this
god, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none
other than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was
originally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,
or wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with
these Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had
the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in
perfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,
considering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to
Babylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the
Masonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. 
He was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian
goddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, 'The God of
Fortification.'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally
celebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.'  THis strong chief of the
buildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall
characteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the
son of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by
Plutarch, that 'Osiris was black'.......""  Hislop

It was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his
cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told
me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he
started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months
to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately
repented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!)

Nimr-rod from Nimr, a ""leopard,"" and rada or rad ""To subdue.""  It is a
universal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia
of the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of
some leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or
should I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the ""spotted
cow"".

I'll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the ""mystery"" religions that all
find their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to
be a ""cold slap to the face"" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that
Masonry doesn't find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personally
talked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.  Why are you now separating
yourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?

Colonics were a health fad of the 19th century, which persists to this day.
Except for certain medical conditions, there is no reason to do this.
Certainly no normal person should do this.

Frequent use of enemas can lead to a condition in which a person is unable

   When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention,
   the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a
   likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God,
   it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the
   Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to
   believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the
   authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved
   private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I
   suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but
   if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not
   orthodox Catholics in good standing.)

It may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny what
happened at Fatima.  That's a bit strong, it is sort of like saying
that a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists.  What a
Catholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima, without being
called a heretic.  You can be labeled other things for such an
offense, but not a heretic.

Theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent
one must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes.  Things revealed by
God through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent due
to a revelation of God: total and unswerving.  Fatima and Lourdes
demand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human
history.  Perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the Church.

""Approval"" of an apparition by the Church principally means that
whatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith.

I personally think of private revelations as our Lord's way of telling
us what to do at particular periods in history.  He gave us all the
doctrines, etc., 2000 years ago, but we can always use some help in
knowing how exactly to apply what He gave us.

Catholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was a result of a series of
apparitions to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, for example.  The problem
at the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our Lord into
someone without a heart.

The Fatima apparitions were a warning of an impending crisis in the
Church (we are living it), and what to do to save the most souls
possible in such a situation.

Drivel.  I received delivery of my '93 Trans Am 7 weeks after I 
ordered (promised 6-8 weeks), and paid $400 over dealer invoice, 
which is a $1425 discount off of MSRP.  I only have about 370 
miles on it, but so far no problems, and it seems very well put 
together.  By the way, first year production will be about 60,000 
cars.  Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but 
considering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the 
new model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a 
shortage.  GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next 
year (according to a WSJ article).

As I have written time and again, the Hebrew canon was fixed in Jamnia,
Palestine, in 90 AD.  60 years after the foundation of the one, holy,
catholic, and apostolic Church.  Furthermore, the opinons of Jerome do
not count.  He was neither the Church, or the Pope, or an ecumenical
council, or a council in general, or an insturment of the Magisterium of
the Church.  He was a private individual, learned admittedly, but
subject to erro of opinion.  And in exlcuding the deuterocanon, he
erred, as Pope Damsus, and the Council of Carthage, and the tradition of
the Fathers, clearly shows, as I pointed out in my previous post.

I suggest you take heed of the last part of the statement, if you want

The order of the Canon is unimportant, it is the content that matters. 
None of Jesus' statments exlcude the deuterocanon, which were
interspersed throughout the canon.  And remeber, there are some
completely undisputed books, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ecclesiatses, Song
of Songs, Job, etc. that are not quoted in the New Testament, which is
not taken as prejudicial to their being inspired.

with cream but reappear in about 2 weeks.  I had been on 3 rounds of
antibiotics for a resistant sinus infection and my husband had been on
amoxicillin also for a sinus infection.  After six months of this, I went
to a gynecologist who had me culture my husband seminal fluid.  After 7
days incubation he had quite a bit of yeast growth (it was confirmed by
the lab).  A round of Nizerol for him cleared both of us.

He appears to have believed that.  He had a view which was condemned by conciliar
action, which is often taken to be condemnation of the idea of reincarnation.
What was actually condemned was the doctrine of the pre-existence of the soul
before birth.  Similar, but not exactly the same thing.

I would like to see his reasoning behind this.  You may have gotten 
""burned"" by natural disaster prophecies down there, but that
does not mean that every natural disaster/judgement prophecy is
false.  Take a quick look at the book of Jeremiah and it is obvious
that judgement prophecies can be valid.  here in the US, it seems like
we might have more of a problem with positive prophecies, though I
am sure there may be a few people who are too into judgement.

Sometimes God does give words that are difficult to swallow.  The
relative positiveness of a prophecy is not necesarily grounds to
dismiss it.  Much of the OT is not happy stuff.

Well for starters, why use rle files?  You might have a specific program that
needs them, OK, but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thus a 2.4meg
24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg.

The latest versions of XV (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files.
And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit.  Even at 90%
quality (you can't see the difference) the jpeg is way smaller than anything
else even an 8bit gif!

EDTA(chelation therapy) has been used by some physicians to try to remove 
calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial system(not approved for such 
use).  There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung 
disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side
-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also 
binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when 
EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that 
were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove 
calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C 
and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra 
vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium 
from the plaques).

The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably 
can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns 
with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.

	1. ""Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review""
	   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with 
	   magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels. 

	2. ""The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular 
	    disease"" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the 
	    serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be

	3. ""Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis 
	   in cholesterol-fed rabbits"" Atherosclerosis 10:732-7(1990).  
	   Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of

	   added to their normal food.

Since EDTA will also bind magnesium, I've never really liked it's use for 
the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients.

Lines: 69

This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine.
The first fully international issue has been published and echoes 
are quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). 

Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993

Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you 
will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured
in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page
-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited
part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for
knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);
and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to
give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the
journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views
into the discourse.
   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page
expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems
within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other
concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,
mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology 
(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this
page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get
suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express
their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the
area in question.
   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.
The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional 
achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on
one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which
editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should
be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the 
understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.
   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have
a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular
number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation
right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your
colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the
contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.
A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh
ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.
   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)
and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.
You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.
On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual
reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing
in Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.
   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.
You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete
papers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received
several final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,
Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed
texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact
person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,
you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning
our common interest and job.

At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in
every mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various
possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and 
philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,
and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give
proposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail
and by other means.

Sincerely yours,

Anton P. ""Zeleznikar

   Jung may have said that, but he was in no way speaking for the
Catholic Church.  The dogma of the Assumption in no way means Mary is
considered to be God or part of ""the Godhead.""  Therefore it implies no
such thing about the feminine in general.

   Also Jung's statement makes it sound as though the dogma was
announced ""out of the blue.""  This also is incorrect, as dogma is only
the formulation of what has always been part of Tradition.  This dogma
has always been believed, but was not formally defined until the
Assumption was declared as an _ex cathedra_ statement.

I don't have any evidence against water from Lourdes curing MS --
I'm sure there is anecdotal evidence that it does.  Do you really think
that in the absence of a double-blind study I should be indifferent
to the hypothesis that water from Lourdes cures MS?

For what it's worth, I know of only one double blind study of Nystatin
for ""candida hypersensitivity syndrome.""  It was published in the 
New England Journal (I think 1990) and showed no benefit on systemic
symptoms (though I think it reduced vaginal yeast infections, not
surprisingly).  As I recall, the yeast crowd had some major objections
to the study, though I don't remember what they were.

Your hearing curve sounds a lot like mine (thanks, Uncle Sam!).  I've been
wearing Miracle Ear canal aids for about 5 months now and I find them to be
acceptable.  They are molded to the shape of your ear canal, and tuned to 
your hearing curve.  They are comfortable to wear and almost invisible, if
you're worried about that (although if you're currently wearing behind the
ear models, that's not an issue).  The cost:  I paid $1200 each for mine,
through the Miracle Ear counter at Sears.  I've heard that there is a
substantial discount for senior citizens, but I haven't researched that, because
I'm not a senior citizen, yet!

Give them a try; you might be pleasantly surprised!

Point 1:

I'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole
""yeast issue"" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings
of words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized ""jargon"",
necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully
cognizant of since I, too, speak ""jargonese"" when with my peers).  For the
situation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can
have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the
world at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,
and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of ""systemic"".
It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much
more so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of
this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially
equal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan
the flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get
really ""beat up"" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they
otherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional
""difficult"" patient.

Point 2:

I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not
prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments
have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed
clinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are
part of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any
differently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it
follows that any therapy not on the ""accepted"" list is therefore a non-
therapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or
theory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation
of what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from
a treatment point-of-view.

And by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/
science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as
also being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people
that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where
""standard"" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and
wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid ""scientific"" viewpoint is in
itself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying
intent of the ""scientific"" approach to medicine is to protect the health of
the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the
patient should come first when considering treatment.

What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both
the ""scientific"" and the ""humanitarian"" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I
outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any
physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe
alternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)
for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted
(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such
therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that
there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived
from them.

This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies
the humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients
who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted
medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the
doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing
their license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical
training.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control
more within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned
could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most
productive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm
sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented
more as a strawman to stimulate discussion.

Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to
why I am ""open"" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real
difficulty (read ""apparent hostility"") with the ""coldness"" of the 99.9% pure
""scientific"" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical
treatment is one where both the ""humanitarian"" aspects are balanced with and
by the ""scientific"" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.
Just my 'NF' leanings, I guess.  :^)

All children are born pure, i.e., without sin.
However, most saints would view a pregnancy
outside of marriage as an occasion of mourning.
(Some church members would be much more
judgmental, but that is *their* problem.)

In situations where welfare assistance is 
provided through our Church, bishops usually
require that the family be making some effort to
live the Gospel standards and provide for 
themselves.

However, there are occasions when assistance is
provided because of the children in the home.
As a former bishop of mine said, ""Children are 
always worthy before God.""

>I'm especially

I am not sure what you mean by the term ""bastards""
in this context.

Latter-Day Saints believe that through the
temple ordinances the family unit may be
preserved in eternity.

If you use genealogical material or software
produced by the Church, you may notice a section
for ""temple ordinances.""  Within that section
there should be a spot for signifying ""BIC""
which stands for ""born in the covenant.""

The children born to couple sealed (married)
within the temple are ""born in the covenant""
and are eligible to be part of that eternal
family unit.
Children born to other couples (whether in a
civil marriage or not) would have to be
sealed to their parents after their marriage
is solemnized for eternity.

Supposing a child were born to a woman out of
wedlock, he or she could be sealed to his or
her parents at a later date or adopted into 
any eternal family unit (which may include one
of the birth parents).

>If this is an issue on which the 
>""official"" position has changed over time, I'm interested in learning both old 
>and new beliefs.  E-mail or posting is fine.  All information or pointers are 
>appreciated.

I can't say if this principle of adoption
was revealed at the same time as the sealing 
ordinances, but it has been accepted for the 
~15 years I have been in the Church.

I would tend to discount any admonitions from
the Church authorities against having children
out of wedlock because even though there are
provisions within the Lord's plan to recover
what we have done wrong the Church does not
want to give anyone the impression we can sin
and repent at our leisure.

The point is not about being ""nice.""  ""Nice"" is not a christian virtue.  The
point is that the gifts and fruits of the spirit (by their fruits you shall

GAY christians.  It was the manifestation of the spirit among the gentiles

Of course the whole issue is one of discernment.  It may be that Satan
is trying to convince us that we know more than God.  Or it may be that
God is trying (as God did with Peter) to teach us something we don't
know- that ""God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears
him and does what is right is acceptable to him."" (Acts 10:34-35).

To anyone with experience about Honda Civic (EX or DX) or Saturn SL1:

I would be interested in knowing how reliable these cars are, how expensive
they are to own and operate (parts, maintenance, gas, insurance), if the

That's probably true but it's the closest to it that you're going to get.  
The actual dealer cost depends on a lot of things and even the dealer  
probably doesn't know exactly what it will be until all the factory   
kick-backs, incentives, etc. are paid and that often depends on his volume  
at the end of the month/quarter/whatever. It might be a funny munber but  
it's all you have to start with, except the sticker, and anyone who pays  
sticker price is really being ripped off.

My last car had T-Tops (BIG T-Tops).  My current car is a convertible.
IMHO, if you're after that 'convertible feel', T-Tops, open-top,
sunroofs, moonroofs, whatever, just don't cut it.  There's no
substitute for a convertible.  If you're not after that sun beating
down on you, the wind in your hair and teeth, the flopsum and

For one week, she probably wants to see how you react to the diet. If it
changes anything. 

You can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you
had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave
cooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it's
hard to digest anyway. 

For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal ""last"" longer eat pasta or
rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe
smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the
baby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How
tight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses 
your middle. Be sure not to ""suck in"" your stomach when sitting, again it
will put pressure on the digestive tract. 

Try laying on your sides, back,
and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.
Easier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby
""turn"" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.
When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the
diaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my
second one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he
didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.


Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe
she just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young. 
But this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something
to be avoided if possible. 

Nausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. My
first pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble.
Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better
chance of carrying their baby. (grain of salt here) 

Good luck

Hi Stephen
Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing
a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block the
external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some 
hearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your
own, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and
fill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen
peroxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)
and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and  
firmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the
tenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl 
under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy
a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever
you may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try
adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up
the wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also
safe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse
it out.
Good Luck

Does anyone know of an English language edition that does not show the
verse (or even chapter) numbers.  I have always thought that such an
edition would be very useful - although hard to navigate around.

I have a Scots NT that doesn't show verse numbers, and it is great to
read, particularly longer narrative passages, but my Scots isn't quite
up to doing proper study from this edition - I tend to use it to get a
""feel"" for a story, particularly in the gospels, and then use an
English edition to look for details.

Eliot is right about 2.2 liter engine in the second (and last) generation
MR2's. But the original guy did not indicate the year of his MR2. If it's a
first generation car (like my '85), it has 1.6 liter engine (or perhaps
same engine with a supercharger, if it's '87 -'89).
The sound he describes is common to any older Toyota engine I ever heard.
I don't know the relevance of his observations about oil changes, my simply
makes noise. Not all that annoying, mind you. But you hear it well when the
engine is right behind your left ear :-)

I used to be on lopid.  It did a good job of reducing cholesterol (295
down to around 214), as well as LDL and triglycerides.  Then, I got
pneumonia, and for some reason, the Lopid stopped working very well;
cholesterol and triglycerides soared.  The levels might have stabilized
over time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switch
to Mevicore.  

On Mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to 207,  LDL was 108, 
and HDL was 35; but the trig's were still
very high, around 318, and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal, 
SGOT = 83 (N = 1-35),  GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35).

He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him
concern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol
figures.  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal (""Just
to be extra cautious, though I'm sure it's not a problem.""),
and wants me to go back on it after that.  I suggested maybe Lopid might
be the better choice, and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what
I want to do.  But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond of.

Should the above liver and trig figures be feared?  What happens to
folks with high trig levels?  Is my liver in danger with the above
results?  Would I be better off on Lopid, despite its inconvenient 
side effect, or, perhaps, some other drug?  (Niacin affected my 
liver, too).

	You did a wonderful job of not doing anything humany possible to 
offend us Catholics; hopefully I can be just as careful in my wording as you
were.
	I also don't want to extend this topic into an entire major issue of
debate (anymore than it already is), but just a note or two:

	1.  Please don't talk about Jesus' ""parents""--the doctrinal positions
		of the church an unequivocally different regarding Mary and
		Joseph.  I (personally) have never heard of anything being
		attributed to St. Joseph other than his sainthood; that is,
		no reference *ever* to him being sinless, assumed into heaven,
		immaculately conceived, etc.--all these ideas apply only to
		Mary.

	2.  I would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our
		doctrines about Mary.  Needless to say, that presents a 
		significant problem to those who accept the bible as the only
		source of doctrine.  If, however, one turns to the sacred 
		traditions of the undivided Christian Church, there is no
		problem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a
		unanimous belief among the apostles and all the early 
		generation that Mary was assumed into heaven, body and soul,
		etc. etc.  It wasn't until the reformation that these doctrines
		were called into question.  As far as I am concerned (again, my
		personaly feelings) if it's a choice between the apostles or
		Luther, I'll choose the apostles every time, whether or not
		it is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men
		have determined to be ""the bible"".

	Like a said, just a couple of notes.  As is often said, I believe that
we must agree to (politely) disagree.

discover His absolute truth.

Funny, I thought it meant ""one who fraudulently misrepresents his

27th).  Certainly more precision than conveyed by ""chronic yeast"".

The inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous
representations is far more frightening.  It is fraud to promote a
treatment where the evidence for it is either lacking or against it
and the quacksalver knows so, or error if the honest practitioner
doesn't know so.  Failure to speak out against either bespeaks
incompetency.

	How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with 
	Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will neither 
	marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?

Footnotes in some bibles reference this verse to the Book of Tobit.
Tobit is in the Septuagint. Goodspeed published it in a book called 
""The Apocrypha"". Most any bookstore will have this. At any rate, the Jews 
of Christ's day had this book. It is a story mostly centered around the
son of Tobit who was named Tobias. There was a young lady, Sarah, who had 
entered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession. The brothers 
all died in the chamber before consumating the marriage.

Tobias was entitled to have Sarah for his wife (3:17) because Tobias was
her only relative and ""...she was destined for [Tobias] from the beginning""
(6:17).

Tobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage. The 
seven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven. That does not 
eliminate Tobias, her eighth husband. Tobit is a fun and interesting 
story to read. It's kind of a mythical romance. It's a little shorter 
than Esther.

The LDS also have scriptures that parallel and amplify Luke 20. Most 
notably Doctrines and Covenants 132:15-16.

	""Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry 
	her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as
	he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage
	are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of 
	the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they 
	are out of the world.

	""Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor 
	are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which
	angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are 
	worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of

I think that if someone often has immoral dreams, like lustful dreams, 
or dreams where you commit acts of violence, etc. etc. it may be a sign 
that he has something sinful in his heart.  It may be the Holy Spirit's
way of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that
we can pray about it and have it removed.  Generally, if one has a 
pure heart, and sets his mind on things that are holy, he will be holy
even when he dreams.

Dreams also can be from the Lord.  Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples
of people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord.  

Regarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to be
careful with.  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especially
if what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else.
Christians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate
an out of body experience.  Some things that might be called an OOBE
might actually be from the Lord.  Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE.
In II Corinthians 12, he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught
up into the third heaven.  Is an OOBE truely an OOBE?  Does one really
leave his body, or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a
spirit, be it a demon or the Holy Spirit?  I don't think it matters
that much.  Paul could not tell.  

Be that as it may, we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan
to experience OOBE's.  We should not meditate and pretend we are in a 
place until our spirits apparently float there.  This is dangerous.  If
God wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE, then He can do that of His
own sovereign will.  In the Bible, most often it seems that prophets are
just taken up by God's sovereign will, and not because they are seeking
an OOBE.  John was in the Spirit praying on the Lord's day when he was
caught up in the visions he received.  Ezekial was talking with some
Jewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God one
time.  If God wants to take one of us up into a vision, he can do it.
People should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spirits
for the sake of a few thrills.

The problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this
passage *is* marriages that were performed on earth.  Jesus' words
seem to me to indicate that He regards His response as the answer to their
question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection.
This being the case, the most straightforward interpretation, in my
opinion, is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those
who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now.  Other-
wise, why would Jesus offer ""but are like the angels in heaven"" as a
contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in
marriage?  We do not have angel-like natures now, but someday we shall,
and when we do, our earthly marriages will be irrelevant.  Or at least,
that's what I think Jesus is saying about the post-resurrection validity of 
marriages performed on earth.  Your mileage may vary. :)

Though this will be addressed in the series of articles I'm posting now under
""ARESNOKOITIA"", I can't wait.  This just really blew my socks off.  Read I Tim
1: 3-11.  Verses 3-8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of
the Mosaic Law.  In vv.9-10, we have, *IN ORDER*, the 5th thru the 9th
commandments and in the midst of this listing is ""homosexuals.""  The decalogue,
above everything else, is seen as God's absolute.  If you don't believe in
absolutes, then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT, which Paul
reveals to be the Messiah of the NT. ""Lord Christ Jesus"" transliterates to read
""Jehovah's Anointed Savior.""  
  In I Cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan
gentiles as we do in Lev 18-20.  In I Cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards)
is not found in Lev 18-20.  Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX.  He knew
full well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT, for
application in the NT.  As I've said, the Law was fulfilled, not done away
with.

We can do better than ""probably"" which is not an adequate defense against the
statement that Paul's culture didn't have the same understanding of
homosexuality as ours.  
Again read the article because it uses facts.

>>I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is
>>not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.
>
>I don't see how you come to that conclusion.

I think I do, because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of
working with AIDs patients.  The pastoral is merely the practical application
of the theological truth however.  Those who are working thru the issue of
homosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who
is contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend,
yet you continue to witness to him.  But, once the choice is made, and there is
no remorse, then I feel that Paul's ""pastoral"" care, as presented in the
Corinthian Church, come to bear significance.  THe one in active rebellion
should be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer,
then one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand.  If there was a member
in your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldn't
hesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly.  That, in part, betrays
the present ""political correctness"" of the issue.  Pederasty is not accepted at
the present, but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is
politically correct, while the former is not -at least not yet.  THis is how
the morals decay.  

I guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of
economics.  The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal, yet in their own
states, when they try to get businesses to settle there, they give tax
incentives to these same richies.  It comes down to a moral code of
relativeness, or to use the cultural thing, politically correct -at the moment.

[You might want to look over 1 Tim 1:10 again.  If this is really the

possible if ""arsenokoitia"" has a narrower meaning than homosexuality
in general, but I think that's not your thesis.  I have no objection
per se to the idea that the author of 1 Tim might have quoted the 10
commandments, but 5 through 9, minus one and plus a few things, begins
to look a bit marginal.  --clh]

There is a BIG difference between the status of what you refer to as
Alexandrians (actually, this includes all Oriental Orthodox Churches
and not only Copts) and that of Nestorians. The Oriental Orthodox
Churches never even ""shelter"" Eutyches (the advocator of Monophysitism)
but on the contrary, it condemned (and still does condemn) him and his
heresy. That is why the Eastren (Chalcedonian) Orthodox Church held
talks with the Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) that started 30 years ago
and still continueing till today, but they have converged on many
issues the most imporatant of which is Christology (I have more 
details of the inter-Orthodox dialogue, in case anyone is interested).
So I do not see how the ""Alexandrians"" and the Nestorians are in a
similar position.

I agree that there are no verses that have gone unchallenged by gay rights

The story in Genesis 19 tells of the citizens of Sodom demanding an opportunity 
to ""know"" the two men who were Lot's guests; the fact that the Sodomites became 
angry when Lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they 
were interested only in homosexual intercourse.  Yes, what they wanted was 
rape, homosexual rape, and everybody agrees that that is wrong.  Some 
Christians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as 
sinful as the rape aspect of their desire.  The passage does not say what it 
was that so offended God, whether it was the homosexuality, or the intended 
rape, or both, but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible 
alternatives in the light of related Scriptures.  I do not believe that those 
who believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying 
to say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape.

You seems to take the view that the *only* sin described in Gen. 19 is in the 
fact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape, and that it is unfair to 
""stigmatize"" their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape.  I can 
see how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion 
that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, but then again we're not 
supposed to start from our conclusions because that's circular reasoning.  If 
God is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general, then the more 
probably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites' 
blatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape.  Later on I 
will document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises 
*any* homosexual intercourse, even if both partners are consenting adults.

>The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_
>in this.  

The moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church 
as the proper  authority for determining what *kinds* of marriages would be 
legitimate, and thus the church's refusal to recognize ""perverted"" marriages 
was circular reasoning.  My questions, however, had nothing to do with the 
church ordaining new kinds of marriages, and so his argument was something of a 
straw man.  In terms of my original question, the precise 
definition/translation of ""porneia"" isn't really important, unless you are 
trying to argue that the Bible doesn't really condemn extramarital sex.  I'm 
not sure the moderator was trying to do that.

In any case, I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here.  
When Jesus was asked about divorce, He replied, ""Have you not read, that He who 
created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'For this 
cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife; and 
the two shall become one flesh'?  Consequently they are no longer two, but one 
flesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate."" (Mt. 
19:4-6).  I read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife 
(female) is a divinely-ordained union.  In other words, the institution of 
heterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by God--not by men, 
and not by the church, but by God.  Men are not supposed to dissolve this 
union, in Jesus' words, because it is not something created by men.

This is not circular reasoning, this is just reading God's word.  I read in the 
Bible that God ordained the union of male and female.  I do not read of any 
similar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females.  Granted, there 
have been uninspired men who have ordained ""alternative"" unions (isn't Caligula 
reported to have ""married"" his horse?), but the only union that Jesus refers to 
as ""what God has joined together"" is the heterosexual union of a man and his 
wife.

(Pardon me for mentioning Caligula.  I know that's probably inflammatory, and I 
should save it for the discussion on bestiality, in part 2 of this post.  
Please hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of 
my reply.)

Anyway, my original question was not whether we should translate ""porneia"" in a 
way that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex, my question was: 
given that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as 
divinely-ordained, and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of 
marriage, is homosexual intercourse sinful?  Of course, I see now that first we 
need to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage.  You 
seem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and 
other sins) are really wrong:

>>I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of

Alternatively, it may be that the definition of such terms as ""porneia"" and all 
the rest was, in Paul's day, what we would call a FAQ; i.e. the Law, as the 
""tutor"" appointed by God to lead us to Christ, had just spent some sixteen 
centuries drumming into the heads of God's people the idea that things like 
homosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death.  
Perhaps Paul didn't go into detail on what ""porneia"" &c were because after 1600 
years he considered the question to have been dealt with already.  Perhaps the 
reason God's apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining 
a distinct, New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any 
significant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law.  
I'll discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below, but I just 
wanted to point out that the New Testament's failure to develop a detailed new 
standard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about 
sexual conduct--especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for 
practicing homosexuality!

And how do you define an ""obsessively driven"" mode of sexual behavior?  How do 
you determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex 
drives?  Is the desire to have ""sinful"" sex an obsessively driven mode of 
behavior?  I think you see that this is circular reasoning:  Why is it defined 
as sinful?  Because it is obsessive.  What makes it obsessive?  The fact that 
the person is driven to seek it even though it's sinful.  Or is it obsessive 
because it is a desire for that which society condemns?  Once again, that's 
circular:  Why is it defined as obsessive?  Because the person wants it even 
though society condemns it.  Why does society condemn it?  Because it is 
obsessive.

You seem to be trying to limit the Bible's condemnation of ""porneia"" to only 
""perverted"" sex acts, but I don't think you can really define ""perverted"" 
without falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of.  What, 
then, is Paul condemning when he declares that ""Fornicators...shall not enter 
the kindgom of heaven""?

>I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.

I think you misunderstood me:  I was not trying to make an argument on some 
technical definition of ""porneia"", I was raising the issues of the sinfulness 
of extramarital sex and the lack of any Scriptural evidence of a homosexual 
counterpart to the divinely-ordained union of heterosexual couples.

I am glad you asked.  Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual 
intercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses, then this 
would show that God's condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual 
law?  If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual 
behavior of people who were *not* under the Law of Moses, would you agree that 
God's definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to 
just the ritual law and those who are under the Law?

subject of the Sabbath, and my main point against a Christian sabbath-keeping 
requirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to 
rest on the sabbath, nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on 
the Sabbath.  This illustrates the difference between universal requirements 
such as ""Thou shalt not kill"", and requirements that are merely part of the 
(temporary, Jews-only) Law of Moses, such as the Sabbath.

The point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of 
homosexual intercourse as ""an abomination"" is *just* a part of the temporary, 
Jews-only Law of Moses.  I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by 
God as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, and that He punished those 
guilty of this behavior by death or exile.  Here's why:

Back in Genesis 15, God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in 
the possession of ""the Amorite""--kinda hard on the Amorite, don't you think?  
But in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds:  
it seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while, because ""the 
iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete"".

Remember, this is all long before there was a ritual law.  What then was the 
iniquity the Amorite was committing that, when complete, would justify his 
being cast out of his own land and/or killed?  Go back and look at Lev. 18 
again.  Verses 1-23 list a variety of sins, including child sacrifice, incest, 
homosexuality, and bestiality.  Beginning in verse 24, God starts saying, ""Do 
not defile yourselves by any of these things; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the 
nations which I am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_.  For the 
land has become defiled, therefore I have visited its punishment upon it, so 
the land has spewed out its inhabitants... For whoever does any of these 
abominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their 
people.""

Notice that God says the Gentile nations (who are *not* under the ritual Law of 
Moses) are about to be punished because they have ""defiled"" themselves and 
their land by committing ""abominations"" that include incest, bestiality, and 
homosexuality.  Flip ahead two chapters to Lev. 20, and you will find these 
same ""abominations"" listed, and this time God decrees the death penalty on 
anyone involved in any of these things, including, specifically, a man ""lying 
with another man as one lies with a woman"" (Lv. 20:13).  Their 
""bloodguiltiness"" was upon them, meaning that in God's eyes, they deserved to 
die for having done such things.  According to Lev. 18:26-29, even ""the alien 
[non-Jew] who sojourns among you"" was to refrain from these practices, on 
penalty of being ""cut off [by God?] from among their people.""

Under the circumstances, I believe it would be very difficult to support the 
claim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape, and not 
the homosexuality, in Sodom.  Since God took the trouble to specifically list 
sex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the 
Canaanite nations, (not homosexual rape, mind you, but plain, voluntary gay 
sex), I'd say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior, even 
by those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant.

>For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can
>be ""law"" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)
>it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to
>determine why you ""pick"" one and ignore another.

According to II Tim. 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable 
for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness; thus, I 
believe that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law, we can 
learn from studying it.  If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is 
a violation of the Law, then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law 
(for example, in the case of Sabbath-keeping).  Where God reveals that certain 
actions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law, then I 
conclude that God's objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a 
person is under the Law, but on the sinfulness of the act itself.  In the case 
of homosexuality, homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling 
abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, i.e. for those who are not under the 
Law as well as for those who are.  Thus, I am not at all trying to say that 
Gentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law, I am simply 
saying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not 
obligated to keep the Law.  If this is so, then I do not think we can appeal to 
our exemption from the Law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice God has 
declared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both Jew and Gentile.

Ezek 22:26 God seems to be upset with the priests who have made no
difference between the holy and the profane.  This brought to my mind a
sermon I heard recently in which the speaker said ""God's second name does
not begin with a D"" referring, I believe, to use of God's holy name and
titles as swear words.  I was also reminded of the experience of Moses at
the burning bush when God told him ""Take off your sandals, for the place
where you are standing is holy ground.""

These and other texts seem to imply that God's people must treat holy
things differently from other ""common"" things, or ""make a difference""
between holy and common things.

The obvious questions are 

What makes something holy? and How are Christians (primarily) supposed to
make this difference between holy and common things?  (e.g. God's name,
the Holy Spirit, the Holy Bible, etc.)

It's always a two-way street.  God gave her the grace to avoid sin,
thus when she was visited by Gabriel, she gave her fiat, her total
acceptance of God's will.  This fiat summarizes why Catholics regard 
her as the highest of all humans, that God chose her and that she
accepted.  Knowing this in advance, we extrapolate that she was
neither stained by nor subject to original sin.

God did create us all miraculously free to choose or not choose to sin.
""Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof and the grace of God to
command it.""  This amount of grace was precisely determined by God
to be the amount required to do what God asked of her.  The grace
given to each of us is also enough, but we do not always choose
to accept it.  We also believe Jesus was fully human and never
sinned.  

God could have created a much better person than myself, one who
always chose the right thing, yet he created me instead, despite
my flaws.  He proves he loves me as I am, continually drawing me
towards perfection.  For whatever purpose he has for me, he has
confidence that I will accomplish it.  If I ask God to repeat his
miraculous creation of the mother of his son, where will that leave me?

Limited Tort Option will lower your rates. If you choose it, you can't
sue others for pain & suffering, but you still can sue for economic loss.
So you can sue for your wrecked car and for medical bills, but you can't
sue for $1000000 for pain and suffering.

At least, that's how I understand it.

I don't think we should draw borders around newsgroups, christians
are free to read and post entries on the atheist newsgroups, and 
muslims are free to so so in other groups as well.

It's up to each individual to define their time schedule concerning 
postings. The problems we all have noticed on various newsgroups
is the evangelistical method of telling that 'I am right, and you are
wrong'. This is true of both theists and atheists.

Hopefully a more constructive dialogue between the groups 
would help concerning assumptions and colorization of views.

I'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's car.  Before
I delve into its innards, I thought I'd check ""net.wisdom"" on the
subject. :)

It's a 1985 Buick Skyhawk (I know...I know)
2.0l EFI 4-banger
auto
35k miles

When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at
highways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of
getting ""stuck"" in 3rd gear.  As a result, when you stop for
a light the motor stalls.  Putting the car in park, and waiting
for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission
to ""reset"" and go back into 1st.  Otherwise, it just stalls when
put in drive.  

My thoughts:  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting
stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up
converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  The least
likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum
hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of
vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves).

My background is that my father owns a service station and
I worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age.  Please
feel free to be as technical as you want. :)

I'd appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of free
beer. <grin>

the point that they are trying to make is that while everybody settles
for the orthodox inline 4, they are using a horizontally opposed 4,
which is unique in that market segment.  and porsche also uses a flat
six in their 911, so what's the problem?  i don't see any claim that

that they use the same configuration as a porsche.. if you want to

this.

Perhaps one other thing I should have added is that Jeremiah's prophesies
about the coming destruction of Jerusalem would have been understood by
the people of that time to be a full frontal assault on their understanding
of their relationship with the Lord. Today the if the general populace 
hears ""prophesies"" like the Portland earthquake or New York will burn
ones, they are unlikely to see it in the context of their relationship
(or lack of it) with the Lord. They are far more likely to think that
they are just the result of the fevered imaginations of a religious nutter.
That is one reason why I am always deep;y suspicious of bald judgement
prophesies without any explanation of the reasons for the judgement. This
doesn't have to be long winded. To see a relatively modern example look
at Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural speech. The relevant section is
below. It is this type of spiritual insight which was missing in both
prophesies posted here.

--- Excerpt from Abraham Lincoln's 2nd Inaugural speech----

Both read the same Bible, and pray 
to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem 
strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing 
their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not
that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not he answered that of neither
has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. ''Woe unto the
world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to
that man by whom the offence cometh"" If we shall suppose that American 
Slavery is one of those offences which, in the provdence of God, must needs come
but which, having  continued through  His appointed time, He now wills to remove
and that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to
those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein an departure from
those divine attribute which the believers in a Living God always  ascribe 
to Him ? Fondly do we hope - fervently do we pray - that this mighty 
scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, 
until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of 
unrequited  toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn  with 
the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three 
thousand  years ago, so still it must be said ""the judgments of the Lord, 
are true and righteous altogether""
  With malice toward none; with charity for all;  with firmness in the right, 
as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we 
are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have 
borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan - to do all which 
may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, 
and with all nations.

   OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,
   the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.

   First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
   realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a
   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).
   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results
   (for better or for worse).

   I pulled out a copy of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that I had recorded off TV
   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where
   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized
   a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space
   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only
   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.

   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot
   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then
   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,
   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled
   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default
   ""2.00"" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten
   frames.

   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used
   for the results I'd been reporting earlier.

   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.

   That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short
   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard
   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate
   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk
   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.

   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240
   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who
   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in
   action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's
   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...

   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.

   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with
   ""preferred"" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played
   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).
   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was
   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with
   ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this
   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task
   switching.

   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see
   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight
   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.

   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also
   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance
   even more...

I'm afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that
can significantly affect QuickTime's playback speed that you may want to take
into account:

(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a
movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16
bit, but other depths are (of course) possible).

(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for ""double size"" scaling, other scaling
factors hit peformance much harder).

(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices
to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I'm not sure about Premiere).

Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size
is, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also
make a real difference.

Forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...

	Ahh Broncos.  Well personally, I have a '78.  The blue book is just
a hair over 3 grand.  I bought it for 2500 and then bought new tires 650
front end rebuild 350, carb rebuild 130.  Then i did the unthinkable
and blew the engine (not bronco specific, unmaintained engine with 168,000)
2400 more bucks there, now it is in nice condition, well after new seats out
of a t-bird, radio, 2 amps, speakers, alarm, well the radio and amps were 
free and i bought the speakers used for 40 bucks, and the other speakers
i took out of my old jeep (Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask,
but it was a Wagoneer).  Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rear
axels, ford 9"" and a dana 44 up front.  Watch the rear axel wrap, i 
busted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and 
haven't had a problem since.  Also the bottom of the doors tend to 
rot, bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones
that might be in your budget.  The post 80 broncos have that sickly
TTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were
as the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms(ie more prspective
wheel travel).  The only rust i have is on my doors and a few
dings in the sheet metal.  I don't know when the removeable tops were
discontinued but they are fun.  I just ordered a full convertable top
for 400$ for mine(credit card).  Don't ever break the window if you
have the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over
400 bucks to replace.  My bronco also does pretty good offroad,
i haven't bottomed out my suspension, YET, and have crossed over
3 foot deep of water with no problems, handles rocks like a charm too.
One problem is it is WIDE and you sometimes can't follow a CJ or a
Toyota, between two rocks or trees, and your grandmother will have
a hard time getting up into it.

No, MIS folks have infinite budgets of death, and they also get parts
of their budget allocated ""upgrades"", ""maintenance"", and ""new purchases"",
and a lot of IBM mainframe purchases are actually ""leases"" and so
is the software.

Basically, the engineers who have tight budgets, i.e. the coders and
designers of a company, bitch and moan when they drop 15,000 on a 
Sparc 1 only to see a faster machine appear a year later.  MIS types
upgrade once every 5-10 years, and their costs are amortized and
depreciated over a longer period, and the budget office justifies
the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting,
payroll, etc.

Now, if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some
reason like payroll and accounts, you'd sure as hell see every
engineer with a new Cray on his desktop every year. :-)

This concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed. When the clutch
is first used in the morning, about the first 4 miles of shifting, there
is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up.  Then the
clutch shifts smoothly.  This chatter started when I moved to the San 
Francisco Bay area from a low-humidity environment.  The dealer stated
that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to
non-asbestos clutch material.  No remedy!! Seems that moisture on clutch

I agree about the durability of the old TH400 trannies from GM.  While I 
never intentionally slamed my '68 Firebird 400 ci Conv. into gear, I would leave 
the trannie in Low (read 1st), grab hold, hit the pedal, and once the tires 
grabbed, take off.  When I reached about 57-60mph the turbo 400 Auto would 
shift to S (read 'super' or 2nd) and leave about 10 to 15 foot of double 
stripped rubber on the ground.  Most everyone I knew at the time was quite 
impressed with 'peeling' out at 60 MPH.  The trannie held up just fine.
Motor mounts would last about a year until I tied the motor down with large
chains.  Oh yea,FYI:    Pontiac 400 ci bored 0.04 over

You probably were trying to be facetious but just for the record partial nasal
obstruction is correlated with a number of chronic disorders such as migraine,
hyperthyroidism, asthma, peptic ulcer, dysmenorrhea, and lack of libido (:-) )
[Riga IN. Rev d'Oto-Neuro-Ophthalmol 1957;24:325-335], cardiac symptoms
[Jackson RT. Annals of Otology 1976;85:65-70  Cvetnic MH, Cvetnic V. Rhinology
1980;18:47-50     Cottle MH. Rhinology 1980;18:67-81], and fever, inadequate
oral intake and electrolyte imbalance [Fairbanks DNF. Otorhinolaryngology Head
and Neck Surgery 1986;94:412-415).

So before you post your inane comments it would be nice if you'd run a MEDLINE
search on the topic say back to 1966. There's been extensive literature on this
for over a 100 years.

I may be in cardiology but I've had a very good working relationship with
my colleagues from ENT.

But that is exactly what I was asking. If the Homosexual community (is that

behaviour but rather condones it then how do they interpret these verses. I

i'm a little confused about the difference between this ""weak atheism"",
as you put it, and agnosticism.  is agnosticism not believing or
necessarily disbelieving in anything, or what is it?  i used to be
agnostic (by this definition) -- but if weak atheism includes not
necessarily believing in God, then i guess i was one of those.  ???

actually what i have a hard time understanding is people who do not
ever decide what they believe.  i am constantly in a state of
self-examination, as it would appear many others are as well (including the

tough call, as these things seem to be based on faith -- wish i could
help you, but i already tried once with someone who was a
self-professed agnostic-thinking-of-becoming-a -christian, and it
didn't work too well!  especially tough as i'm still mulling over
whether or not i believe in miracles (looks like another email to my
chaplain is coming up....).  all i can do is wish you the best of
luck, and please do post what you find.

>And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that
>I can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how.

hmm, how so?  i guess i really don't understand.  there are times, of
course, when i say to myself ""of course i have absolutely no way of
knowing that what i believe in is true except the satisfaction and
sense of peace i get from it -- which of course could just be
psychological"".  somehow i live with this anyway -- is this what you
mean?

the only ""proof"" i have is that i believe God spoke to me once --
which could of course be my own imagination.  the odd thing is,
though, that if you don't at some point start believing in something,
after a while it all gets sort of ridiculous.  maybe it's just a
question of where you draw the line.

converting you, since i don't seem to have whatever it would take --
proof -- to do so.  i'm just interested in learning.)

Sounds pretty familiar.  I posted similar cries about last September when
Caroline just entered daycare.  She was two, then, and have been with 
continuous colds since until last March.  As spring approaches, her colds
slowed down.  Meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds.
Only once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she
had antibiotics.  (The other time was due to sinus infection, and I wished
that I did not give her that awful Septra.) 

>Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions?

There are the 'net studies' -- that is, if you read this newsgroup often,
there will be a round of questions like this every month.  There might
be formal studies like that, but bear with my not so academic experience.
Okay?

Gee, I bet 50/50 you'll hear cases in all these catagories.

I am pretty sure, an insulated child at home sicks less.  But, that child 
still will face the world one day.

>-- Does being sick ""build immunity"" (leading to less illness later),

That's what I believe and comfort myself with.  Caroline will get more
and more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other 
kid's mouth nor let other kids do the same.  Cold virus mutate easily.
However, I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these
diseases, so she would be less severely affected.  Everytime she has a cold,
we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp 
at night so she can have good rest (thanks to some suggestions from the net).
That's about all the care she needs from us.  I try very hard to keep her
off antibiotics.  Twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would
have antibiotics.  I waited just long enough (3-4 days) to see that she
fought the illness off.  I do understand that you don't have much choice if
the child is in pain and/or high fever. 

>does it make kids ""weaker"" (leading to more illness later), or does it
>not have any long term effect?

If the child doesn't rely on antibiotics to fight off the sickness everytime,
then the child should be stronger.

>

> 
I'll leave this to expert.

>
If your child just entered daycare, I'm pretty sure the first 6 months will be
the hardest.  (Then, you get more used to it.  Boy, do I hate to see me typing
this sentence.  I recall when I read something like this last September, I said 
to myself, 'oh, sure.'  But, I do get used to it, now.)  However, I do hear 
people say that it does get better after a year or two.  I am looking forward 
to a healthier next winter.  As it gets warmer, I hope you do get some break 
soon.

>-- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?

Eat well, sleep well.  Try not to use antibiotics if not absolutely necessary.

Good luck.

Without quoting at length from the preceeding post, I'd just like
to say that I find it a much more appropriate way of dealing with
issues like the Holocaust and Bosnia that asserting that ""God is
punishing them.""

The activity of God is always _redemptive_, which means ""restoring
what has been lost, broken, or distorted.""  So, God does not _will_
the brokenness, lostness, distortion, genocide, poverty, etc, but
is nonetheless capable, willing, and active to restore, heal, mend,

Woo! So far, we've had the following interpretations of the figure of
the `Whore of Babylon' in Rev 17 & 18:

a) The United States of America
b) MHO dB) which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who
   corrupt and oppress human society
c) Historical Jerusalem
d) Historical Rome

Dare I suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning? How
about * The prophecy reveals God's judgement on the corrupt & idolatrous
state oppressing his chosen people (d) * That God's judgement extends
_especially_ to his once chosen city (c) because, despite that City's
special call, it still rejected God's grace at the decisive time (Rev
11:8? - also isn't Rev19:24 equally suggestive of Rome as Jerusalem?) *
That the USofA is guilty of many of the crimes of Rome/Babylon (a) and
is equally subject to God's judgement * That the Good Book(TM) actually
encompasses _all_ these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual
powers warring against mankind through the very society that we've
created. (b)

Clever, huh? (<-- Flame here!) No need to argue at all! 

I think Mary's view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a
deliberate contrast between Rev 17/18 and Rev 21/22 - the mortal
Jerusalem chosen by God but never (historically) fulfilling its vocation
and the new Jerusalem perfected (outside of history) purely by God's
grace. eg Details like Rev 17:1 `.. who sits on many waters' cf Rev 22
the single stream in the new Jersualem `the river of life flowing from
the throne of God and of the Lamb.'

Rex - didn't understand your post - what's the relevance of Babylonian
mystery religions to all this? Please elaborate your ideas about OT &
the Book of Rev? Why do you freak at the idea of a primarily `spiritual'

>Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e Cd) mentioned in magazines.  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but
>what does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33.

It's pretty complex, and Cd isn't the whole story either.  Cd for cars is
usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large car
with a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a
poorer Cd. 

To calculate drag use this formula:

D = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S

Where D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),
V is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the
pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure
(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). 

Note that power is:

P = F * v

Where P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v
is velocity (ft/s). 

Note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for
force) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That's why huge increases in power
result in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd. 

So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new top
speed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)

101 mph

Sorry to dissappoint.

   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,
   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.
   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,
   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,
   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.

   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. 
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)

NAME
   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations

DESCRIPTION
  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on
  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both
  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.

  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their
  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the
  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using
  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The
  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed
  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.

  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and
  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss
  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing
  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type
  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of
  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into
  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple
  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with
  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take
  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).

  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing
  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence
  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be
  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image
  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-
  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically
  giving great flexibility in processing an image.

FEATURES

  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a
  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, 
  the processed image will be displayed.

  Current features include

  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing
    and filling the ""rotated out"" region with an arbitrary color.

  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with
    the option of subpixel sampling.

  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an
    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving
    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to
    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text
    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as
    in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha
    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.

  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.

  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation
    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary
    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels
    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of
    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished
    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-
    lability of graphical histograms of the image.

  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-
    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at
    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some
    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering
    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,
    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions
    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a
    circle).

  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-
    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.

  o Performs histogram equalization.

  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of
    arbitrary order.

  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.

  o Cuts and pastes across images.

  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.

  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause
    interval between images. (SlideShow)

  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels
    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities
    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.

  o Performs image type conversions.

  o Converts image formats.

  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).

  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image
    back and display it.

  o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values.

  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the
    resulting power spectra.

  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).

 SUPPORTED FORMATS
      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS
      o  JPEG(JFIF) format
      o  CompuServ GIF
      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.
      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)
      o  TIFF
      o  PostScript(Write only)

Hardware requirements:
---------------------------------------------------------------
   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.

Where to get it:
---------------------------------------------------------------
   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z
   where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73

   Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking

Acknowledgement:
---------------------------------------------------------------
   JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups's library Version 4.
   FORMS library, developed by Mark Overmars, is used for GUI.
   Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release.

---------------------------------------------------------------
  Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate
  images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of
  your editing needs. In addition, the external filter and dynamical
  kernel will utilize any program you already have. So try it
  (and you will like it).
  
  As always, any comments/bug reports are welcome.

III. ***** NEWS FROM THE WIRES ******

Sender: Jonathan Lord <jml4s@uva.pcmail.virginia.edu>
Subject: RESURGENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONCERNS CDC
Date: Thursday April 15, 1993

ATLANTA (UPI) --   A resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly
emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation's
health care system, federal health officials said Thursday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reporting its latest
findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that
sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four, said it will
put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases.

Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled ""Emerging
Infectious Diseases"" to be featured in the CDC's Morbidity & Mortality
Weekly Report, which has a wide circulation in the health community.
The issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific
counselors to update the CDC's draft plan for dealing with the growing
threat of infectious ailments.

""This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility
to deal with it,"" said Dr. Ruth Berkelman, deputy director of the CDC's
National Center for Infectious Diseases.

There were more cases of malaria in the U.S. in 1992 than in any year
since the 1960s, and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic,
the first in this century, she said.

Resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem.
""We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past""
Berkleman said.  She said even common ear infections frequently seen in
children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.

""Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases
would soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases

causes AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.

""The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,

HEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues

The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause
damage: legal liability.

A federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not
doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much
attention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like
illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in
rare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners
on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from
the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if
someone becomes infected while on the property.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came
after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the
Long Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the
disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered
the New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than
$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical
expenses and lost wages.

Summer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or
semirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the
groups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.
Kass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a
legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential
liability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard
barbecue might be potentially liable.

Lawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summer
vacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home
she rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky
Mountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered
an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was
stung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent
quadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence
that a beehive was near the restaurant.

But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the
country -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic
states, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this
particular insect bite a particularly litigious one.

The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the
courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will
cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not
diagnosing the disease.

Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease
have become common in some states in recent years. Payments in
worker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and
lost earnings.

The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more
lucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of
negligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing
injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a
result, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property
owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many
other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the
disease.

Ira M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &
Maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help
to establish ""the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect
against Lyme disease.""

Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning a
lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For
one thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when
and where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs
in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned
by the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.
The workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to
the insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded
some work sites.

A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that
the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is
considering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding
that it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says
the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special
pants to protect against bug bites.

Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up
some legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a
victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.
Earlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association
reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.
And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical
disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.

Because of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies
already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last
year, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson &
Co. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston
that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical-
supply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company
was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might
get infected.

Ruth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in
Indianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her
organization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole
Katz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners
Association, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their
100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing
pesticide.

TITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease.
AUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH,

University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
REFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30

Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is
associated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients
with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.
Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and
detrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not
noted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract
may be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding
dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may
directly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the
Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological
symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was
protracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological
deficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme
disease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential
diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder
management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic
evaluation is recommended.

  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid the
compost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became
infected.

  A friend of mine here in Oregon who has a compost heap would like me to
back that claim up with documentation.  Do lyme-carrying ticks hang out in
compost heaps?
Thank you.

   Rex, there are literally hundreds of thousands of 32nd degree
Masons in this country, and thousands of 33rds. If nasty stuff was
really going on, don't you think you'd have more than a couple of
disgruntled members ""exposing"" it? Heck, if what you say is true, then
Rev. Norman Vincent Peale is an Osiris worshiper.
 
[...
Long quote from someone named Hislop (source not given) deleted. I'm
attempting to extract from it the relevent points: 

  * Osiris is actually Nimrod, a Babylonian Deity. 

  * ""It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was originally
    founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother, or
    wife of Osiris.""

  * The Babylonian Nimrod and Osiris are both connected with the building
    trade, ie, with Masonry.

  * Nimrod, as the son of Cush, was a negro. [isn't this refering to a 
    Biblical Nimrod, rather than the Babylonian god?]

  *  ...there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by Plutarch, that 'Osiris
     was black'.
...]

     There is a long tradition in Masonry of claiming ancient lineage
for the order, on the flimsiest of grounds. This dates right back to
the Constitutions of 1738, which cite Adam as the first Mason. I've
seen other claims which place Masonry among the Romans, Greeks, and
Egyptians, and Atlanteans. I even have a book which claims to prove
that Stonehenge was originally a Masonic temple. 

    Claims prove nothing. Where's the beef, Rex?

[...Claims ex-Mason showed him leopard skin he wore in lodge]

   I'd have to check this. The tomb paintings I remember don't show
this.

   Can you give ancient citations for this? The druids were suppressed
over 2000 years ago. What's your point?

   This whole ""leopard skin"" business sounds bizarre.  I have not yet
gone through the Scottish Rite (which contains all of those ""higher
degrees"" anti-Masons get so excited about, and which was invented in
the 1750's), but I know enough people who have (and who are good
Christians), that I reject your claim.

Not so much a 'slap in the face' as 'a weary feeling of deja vu'. I'm
going through a very similar argument over on soc.culture.african.american.

   Because we got honest. If you can come up with actual evidence that
Masonry existed prior to 1390, I'd be VERY impressed (actually,
anything earlier than 1630 would be pretty good.)

on various kind of workstations, they are DECstation, HP, Amiga, Apollo.

	Secondly, I read from some graphic texts that image is displayed
in 24 bites(please point out to me if I got it wrong).  But, the images
which I will deal with are displayed in 16 bites by the software they
are using currently.  So, will there be any problems to display them
under X-windows in the future? Because we are thinking to implement the
GUI by X-windows for our project


	Is there any person here can help me to solve the problem or

And here's my two cents:

The best convertible for the money, IMO, is the Miata. Yes, it's small, but
you're buying it as a second car, I hope, so you don't need the cargo room
of a big car. It's got enough power for fun, it's RWD like a sports car
ought to be (I'm gonna regret that :-{) and the top, while manual, operates
like a dream. 30 seconds and one hand to lower, and not much longer to raise.

The targa-type cars are nice, but they're not real convertibles.

In some earlier discussions on this thread I may have
given the impression that even though children didn't 
require baptism it wouldn't hurt if they were.
To the contrary, when you baptize children before
they are capable of comprehending it you deny them 
their opportunity to demonstrate their desire to
serve God.

Have any of you considered that children are not
accountable for sin because they are not capable of 
repentance?
Peter said to a group of ""men and brethren,"" ""Repent
and be baptized every one of you"" (Acts 2:38).
Notice that he specified that if they *repent* then 
they may be *baptized*.

In following Peter's instructions people must first
demonstrate repentance (a forsaking of their sins and 
a desire to obey God's commands) *before* they are 
eligible to be baptized.

Since young children are not capable of repenting,
they are not eligible for baptism.
And since God is both just and merciful ""sin is not 
imputed when there is no law"" (Romans 5:13), young 
children are not accountable for what they can't 
comprehend.

I think the old saying "" hate the sin and not the sinner"" is

don't hate the people.  I don't.  I don't hate my kids when they do
wrong either.  But I tell them what is right, and if they lie or don't
admit they are wrong, or just don't make an effort to improve or
repent, they get punished.  I think this is quite appropriate.  You
may want to be careful about how you think satan is working here.
Maybe he is trying to destroy our sense of right and wrong through

Hello everyone,
   I have an insurance question.

Allstate insurance

SITUATION: Person wrecks car. Car is drivable to dealer. Person 
reports accident (no other cars involved). Driver estimates damage cost 
exceedes cost of car. Insurance people claim car is ""totalled"" because of 
exceeding repair costs.
Person says ""WWHHHAATTTT!!!! But I drove the car here!"" and takes it to 
another place. Other place estimates 2,101.00 in damage. 2,000 less than the 
dealer.
One more hitch... The car is registered in Florida but the accident occurred 
in Pennsyvania.

QUESTION: Should the insurance recognize and pay for the damages of this, 
now fixable, car even though they prematurly declared totalled?

Please respond via E-Mail if you think you know anything about this sort of 
thing.

Charter:  
 
misc.health.diabetes                            unmoderated
 
1.   The purpose of misc.health.diabetes is to provide a forum for the
discussion of issues pertaining to diabetes management, i.e.: diet,
activities, medicine schedules, blood glucose control, exercise,
medical breakthroughs, etc.  This group addresses the issues of
management of both Type I (insulin dependent) and Type II (non-insulin
dependent) diabetes.  Both technical discussions and general support
discussions relevant to diabetes are welcome.
 
2.   Postings to misc.heath.diabetes are intended to be for discussion
purposes only, and are in no way to be construed as medical advice.
Diabetes is a serious medical condition requiring direct supervision
by a primary health care physician.

Enough, already. Let's take this discussion to some other newsgroup

I was just wondering if exercises specific to particular regions of the
body (such as thighs) will basically only tone the thighs, or if fat
from other parts of the body (such as breasts) would be affected just as
much.

Well, this isn't the right group for this, but I have to say that I don't
think violence is any more socially acceptable now, by any means.  How
can you say that when we used to have of pistol-toting gunslingers as 
heros, or even gangland thugs being considered romantic.  Do you think
our great grandparent got yelled at by their parents for playing cowboys
and indians?  I don't think so.  That behavior was somewhat encouraged
back then, in fact.
I think the only difference between now and then is that nowadays, when
some teenager kills another one in a classroom in California, we here 
about it in MA the same day.  Back in the old days, they'd never hear 
about something like that, period.

I'll pick up that PM and have a look -- maybe the picture in there is not
the actual car, but a prototype?

I saw the Mach III and was not all that impressed -- it looked WAY too
Japanese for me... the tear drop headlights reminded me of a Nissan NX...

Glad I didn't hold out for the '94 and bought a '93.  Maybe they'll work on
the design a little bit, listen to consumers and come out with nice-looking
'95 or '96.  It always takes a while to work out the kinks in a new design,
e.g. the F-body Camaro/Firebirds (btw, the new Camaros look like shit too).

Subject: Re: Med school admission
Organization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.
Lines: 61


I'm a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better.  I applied
to about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting to
hear from the other school.

Let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical
school admissions process.  Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything, 
but they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact, some
schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look
at your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refund
on your $50 application fee.

But, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers
and are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response, was it
an acceptance, denial, or wait-list?  If I assume the worst, that it was a
denial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  How
did your interviews go?

As for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contacted
me for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them was
over and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejection
letters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools are
still interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't become
fixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself.

What do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a very
mediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a software
engineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  Still,
I think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted
is something like this:

VERY IMPORTANT
--------------
GPA:	3.5 or better
MCAT:   top 15% in all subject

MEDIUM IMPORTANCE
-----------------
Writing/Speaking ability
Maturity
Motivation for going into medicine
Activities

LESS IMPORTANT
--------------
College or University
Major
Work experience
Anything else you want them to know


Anyway, you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound in
many ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand each
person as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.  But getting 
four interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers.  Hopefully, you
were able to impress them with your character.


Good luck,
Jeff

  Nor is it mine.  What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly
understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections
- which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections. 
Marty made this sound like a secret  known only to veternarians and
biochemists.  Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns
this. At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel
decontamination directed at retaining ""good"" anaerobic flora in an attempt
to prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group.  I also
use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that may
be in part due to alterations in gut flora).  However, it is NOT part of
my routine practice to ""reinnoculate"" patients with ""good"" bacteria after
antibiotics.  I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating
fungal infections in at risk patients.  Whether or not it is a ""logical
extension"" from the available observations I'll leave to those of you who
base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of
clinical trials. 
  One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly
recalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection). There
are case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulate
the patients flora.  Don't try this at home.

  Seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal
conventional wisdom (a euphemism for no data) and doing a good clinical
trial, like: 

AU   Dismukes-W-E.  Wade-J-S.  Lee-J-Y.  Dockery-B-K.  Hain-J-D.
TI   A randomized, double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the
     candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome [see comments]
SO   N-Engl-J-Med.  1990 Dec 20.  323(25).  P 1717-23.
     psychological tests. RESULTS. The three active-treatment regimens
     and the all-placebo regimen
     significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than
     0.001), but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms
     significantly more than placebo. [ . . . ]
     CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasis
     hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic or
     psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently,
     the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such
     women appears to be unwarranted.

  Does this trial address every issue raised here, no.  Jon Noring was not
surprised at this negative trial since they didn't use *Sporanox* (despite
Crook's recommendation for Nystatin).  Maybe they didn't avoid those
carbohydrates . . .

  Marty, you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric
itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic
hypersensitivity symptoms (Noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamin
therapy of undocumented candida enteritis (Elaine Palmer syndrome) with
systemic symptoms.  There is significant difference between the cost and
risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials.  Are we talking about ""real""
candida infections, the whole ""yeast connection"" hypothesis, the efficacy
of routine bacterial repopulation in humans, or the ability of anecdotally
effective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confirm
an etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc).  We can't seem to
focus in on a disease, a therapy, or a hypothesis under discussion. 
          
                           I'm lost!

Well, I think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with
sleep disturbances, because antihistamines only help induce sleep when
they're used intermittently; they lose their sedative effect if they're
used on a nightly basis.  Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions,
relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as
those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement.

Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom)
are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  Chlorpheniramine
(Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to work
well in some people.  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long
half-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residual
hangover or ""drugged"" feeling the next morning.

Does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine, or the two in
combination, can reduce the body's ability to make use of 
available water?  I had kind of an odd experience on a group hike
recently, becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous
hiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters).
I drank close to twice as much as anyone else, and no one else was
dehydrated.  I don't think general physical condition was an issue,
since I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general
stamina, so far as I could tell.

It may be that I just plain need more water than most people.  But I am
wondering if theophylline and/or ephedrine might be aggravating things.
I took a couple of Primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma
(24 mg. ephedrine, 100 mg. theophylline).  I gather that both those
drugs are diuretics.  So now I'm wondering: does that mean they can
reduce the body's ability to utilize available water?  Would it be a
particularly  stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weather
exercise?  (I always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot, but
that wasn't the case yesterday.)

 As far as I can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms
and is expirienced its use and interpretation, he should be just as
capable of reading it as any radiologist. All doctors are ""qualified"" to
read x-rays, u/s, ct scans etc. it is just that a radiologist does nothing
else, and thus, is only better at reading them because of all this time
spent doing this (skill in reading x-rays etc. just comes from plenty of
practice). If your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he
should be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated by
this technique.

It might be interesting for folk to know that the Church of Scotland
(also a Presbyterian church)  managed to ""agree to disagree"" over
women's ordination for 25 years.  The reasoning was that congregations
are free to call whoever they wish, and that Ministers and Sessions
choose elders.  If a congregation did not wish to have a woman, they
were not obliged to, and if a Session did not wish to, they could not
be forced to.  (Note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part
of the Congregation is VERY important here - this year is the 150th
Annivarsary of the Disruption, where the church split on that very
issue, they didn't get back together for almost 80 years).

A couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womens
ordination the position was changed - so that, in theory, all
ministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained.  In
theory, a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his Session, or
refused to work with a woman minister in Presbytery, could be
disciplined.  In practice this has not happened, and I believe it is
unlikely to happen.  My personal view is that the new legislation was
a mistake, and that the permissive (but not prescriptive) legislation
worked very well.  

We are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years
assembly.  At this years, a motion was put to ban the blessing of
same-sex couples (after an Edinburgh minister did so).  Our Panel on
Doctrine is currently looking at marriage, and will report next year -
the matter will be considered and debated then.

Hope this is interesting

Yup.

Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support
only specific video cards. Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for
the VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as
the Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture
quality if your dithering works right).

I can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to
GIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.
You don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA
card and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+
computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a
8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write
some programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other
colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg
dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette
the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would
when viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but
it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way
gives a brighter more detailed image.

Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as
far as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the
VGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)

Have a day!

PRAYING FOR JUSTICE
(by Peter Hammond)

To those involved in ministering to Christians suffering
persecution the imprecatory Psalms are a tremendous source of
comfort. And those of us who are fighting for the right to life
of the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography or
crime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon God
has entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms.


THE IMPRECATORY PSALMS

Early in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers for
judgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how to
respond to them. Prayers such as:
""Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account for
his wickedness ..."" Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the
gospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearly
motivated by love for God (""The Lord is King for ever and ever;
the nation will perish from His land"" 10:16, and ""Why does the
wicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent who
suffer (""You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; You
encourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending the
fatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth,
may terrify no more."" 10:17-18)

Nevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such
graphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: ""Pour out your
wrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them"" 64:24; ""O
Lord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, O
Judge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve.""
95:1-2; ""Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let them
vanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... The
righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe
their feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, ""Surely
the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who
judges the earth.'"" 58:6-11

Certainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeply
destressed by the prevalence of evil -  but could I actually pray
for God to ""pour out His wrath"" on the wicked?

The scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be
prayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies.
Rather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and against
His enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of these
imprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart and
whose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who ""boast of evil""
and ""are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plots
destruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practise
deceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than
speaking the truth."" 52:1-3; ""They crush your people ... They
slay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless."" 94:5-
6; ""With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plot
against those You cherish."" 83:3; ""You hate all who do wrong. You
destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the
Lord abhors."" 5:5-6.

To those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares:
""Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin"" 52:5;
""Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who
go on in their sins"" 68:21.

And the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: ""Then
it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ...""
59:13; ""to proclaim the powers of God"" 68:34; ""All kings will bow
down to Him and all nations will serve Him "" 72:11; ""Who knows
the power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fear
that is due You. "" 90:11

Yet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include
imprecations (prayers invoking God's righteous judgement upon the
wicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church.
However, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much
more common.


PRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS

Amidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I
found the survivors of communist persecution including the
crippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God to
strike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church.
I was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heaven
pray ""How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge
the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?"" Revelation
6:10).

The initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino
Neto. Described as a ""drunken, psychotic, marxist poet"", Neto had
been installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola.
He boasted that: ""Within 20 years there won't be a Bible or a
church left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity."" Yet
despite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is
not Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto.
Neto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in
Moscow.

In Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded
of God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer:
  *  A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be
     arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.
  *  Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles
     in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be
     turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in
     fact carried out. But the next day when the official was
     medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal
     cancer. He died shortly afterwards.
  *  On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a
     Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car
     crash the very next day.
  *  When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on
     the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to
     carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted
     gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation,
     the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to
     dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded
     with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would
     not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against
     Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building
     was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship.
     ""They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord
     Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the
     Lord spread widely and grew in power. "" Acts 19:17,20

Nicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the
persecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and
executed on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of ""the
antiChrist is dead"" in the streets. Many testified that this was
in answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of
Romania.

Another persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora
Machel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machel
was a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in
the 1960's. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would
destroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly
Marxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches in
Mozambique were closed confiscated, ""nationalised"" chained and
padlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled,
some being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibles
were ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians,
including many pastors and elders, were shipped off to
concentration camps - most were never seen again.

A month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly
and challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him
(Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches were
specifically praying for God to stop the persecution in
Mozambique, Machel's Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent
thunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa's
boundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans
for overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and
published. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor,
but He had also saved a country from persecution.

In the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in
Zambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27
year socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on
31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted to
Christ whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was elected
president of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian
country.

It is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots,
declared trembling and in tears: ""I am more afraid of John Knox's
prayers than of an army of ten thousand"".

On 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African
Communist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedented
international wave of condolences and adulation reported one
could be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a
martyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ
Jesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa
this Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani.

The stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people
were murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collective
concern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of
the SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other
victims. Indeed the SA government, the international community
and the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported
over this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans
murdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC were
unbanned!

Yet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973,
Deputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANC's ""military
wing"" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hani
had approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many
unarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: ""all who live by the sword
will die by the sword "" Matt 26:52.

After personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities
at a press conference in Washington DC (where he publicly
declared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, Yasser
Arafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs
and limpet mines in public places during ""the struggle"") I told
him that I was a Christian and, while I didn't hate him, I did
hate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either
bring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that God
would remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that he
was an atheist.

Several other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani
to repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches in
America have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against
unrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struck
down, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer,
within months of these public prayers for God to stop these
killers of preborn babies.

Some praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted:
""When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror
to evildoers "" Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that any
Christian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any -
even of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory
prayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so did
our Lord (Matt 11:20-24).

What then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be?
Should we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues I
would like to present a short summary of an excellent book, ""War
Psalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory
Psalms"" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian and
Reformed Publishing Company):

Our Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantly
in teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes the
Old Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NT
are from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50
times. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.


1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God?

Some Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as
""devilish"", ""diabolical "", ""unsuited to the church"", and ""Not God
's pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of
a man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus'
teaching that we should love our enemies. ""

Yet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares:
""All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching,
rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the
man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. ""
(see also 2 Peter 3:15-16).

The fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our
comprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its
inspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil
is to impudently take the place of God.

Do we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of God
have led many to become ""evangelic plastic surgeons who have made
it their job to ""clean up"" God's Word according to their own
ideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alone
who must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for
His Church. The essence of what many have done is to question the
authority of God's Word (like Eve's original sin of listening to
Satan's question ""Yes, hath God said... ?"").

The Psalms are part of God's revelation of Himself and His
attributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the
authoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which these
evangelical plastic surgeons reject as ""unsuited"" and ""unworthy""
for the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about
Himself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostles
used as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb
4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2.

CH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especially
Ps 109):
""Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage
which the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in
judgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord would
speak to us therein. ""

The rejection of any part of God's Word is a rejection of the
giver of that Word, God Himself.


2. Who is praying these Psalms?

Christ quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actually
spoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied an
enormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayer
book and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at
the Last Supper.

On the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient
authority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very own
words - the words of the Lord's Anointed - which as David's Son
He truly was.
""Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit"" Ps 31:5
""My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?"" Ps 22:1

In His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on
the day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so!
Matt 7:23 ""Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away
from me, you evildoers'. "" Ps 6:8

In Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ
although nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said
these words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22
directly to Christ despite there being no record of His having
spoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believed
Christ is speaking in the Psalms.

Christ came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in
all the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come again
to execute Judgement on the wicked.
David as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a
prototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30:
""being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the
resurrection of Christ. ""
David was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and in
his words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiah
spoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also by
Christ. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His
forerunner David.

The imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of
God, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassion
for the wronged.


3. But what about the Psalms of repentance?

Christ is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice for
our sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with
the sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts for
which He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was the
substitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah
53).

""God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we
might become the righteousness of God. "" 2 Cor 5:21

In history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, have
been understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: St
Augustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others.
All the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying the
imprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the Lord
Jesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It is
only right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy
His enemies.

These prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of
King Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God's Word is revealed
upon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God's way of
forgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses
of God.

He who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a
reality when He declares to those on His left:
""Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared
for the devil and his angels. "" Matt 25:41

All the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *God's
Kingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alone
will reign forever!
""With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes a
sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule
them with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury of
the wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. ""
Rev 19 : 15


4. Are Jesus' prayers contradictory?

What about Jesus' command to love our enemies and to bless those
who curse us (Matt 5:44)?

Christ is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives
sin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement
on those who disobey His Gospel.

""God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you
and give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen when
the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His
powerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel
of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting
destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from
the majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in
His holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have
believed. "" 2 Thess 1:6-10

Jesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power on
earth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we see
both the vengeance and the love ot God.

Even in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations.
""Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of
greed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! You
brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? ""
Matt 23

In Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His
betrayal by Judas.

We also need to acknowledge that Christ's prayers of blessing are
not for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only
praying to the elect of God - those who have:
""obeyed your Word""... ""accepted"" God's Word ... and have
""believed "". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the
message of God's kingdom will be judged.)


5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms?

Martin Luther pointed out that when one prays: ""Hallowed be Thy
Name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done "" then ""he must put all
the opposition to this in one pile and say: 'Curses, maledictions
and disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. May
they be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and
wisdom and plans run aground' . ""

To pray tor the extension of God's kingdom is to solicit the
destruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: ""The God of
heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it
will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it
will itself endure forever. ""

* Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for
the kingdom of darkness. *

There is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Church
cannot exclude hatred tor satan's kingdom from its love for God's
kingdom. God's kingdom cannot come without satan's kingdom being
destroyed. God's will cannot be done on earth without the
destruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction of
evil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism
which insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights
of man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God.

Note Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who ""plot
together"" against God and His people:
""Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O
Lord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and
Jabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like
refuse on the ground. ""

The story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5)
provides a vivid example of God's judgement on the wicked. Sisera
""cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years"" and they
""cried to the Lord for help"" Judges 4:3. In response to those
prayers: ""The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by
the sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot...
All the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. ""
Judges 4:15-16

The account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the
tent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety
and then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. The
song of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of
the head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it is
this that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. ""As
you did to Sisera ...""


6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience

The imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God:
     ""If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law,
     which are written in this book, and do not revere this
     glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord
     will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He
     will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you
     dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also
     bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not
     recorded in this Book of the Law until you are
     destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ...
     so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be
     uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. ""
     Deuteronomy 28:58-63

The covenant God made with His people included curses for
disobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27
records the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in
an awesome account:
""The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud
voice:
""Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing
detestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman's hands - and
sets it up in secret. ""
Then all the people shall say, ""Amen!"" ""
""Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother...
""Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour's boundary stone...
""Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads...
""Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the
fatherless or the widow...
""Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly...
""Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent
person.
""Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by
carrying them out.
Then all the people shall say, ""Amen!"" "" Deut 27:14-26

The New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of
rejecting Christ is the curse. ""If anyone does not love the
Lord - a curse be on him. "" 1 Corinthians 16:22

(See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26-
31; 12:14-29.)


7. How can we preach these prayers?

The Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders.
Scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander-
in-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass on
those orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can we
expect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that the
troops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the
strongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does not
hear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Him
onto the battlefield?

Pastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church's
Commander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose job
is to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain
and severe punishment if he dared to amend the general's orders.
The pastor's charge is of greater importance than that of a
courier in any earthly army. There's no place tor the dispatcher
to decide he doesn't agree with his Commander's strategy.

When Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching
mission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God's Kingdom (Lk
10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to God's
rule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on
any house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected
it, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But we
must consider what He said they should do if their message were
rejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against
God's rule - ""But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go
into its 'streets and say, 'Even the dust of your town that
sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this:
The kingdom of God is near""' Luke 10:11.

What would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, it
will be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sent
fire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that
town (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin,
Bethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message
(verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the great
authority He had given them: ""He who listens to you listens to
Me; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejects
him who sent Me "" (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis tor
calling down God's curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion
against God's authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of
His servants.

We need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the
Prince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from its
lethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass on
the battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks
will be inevitable.

Like Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of
obedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth is
that God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall he
reap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience in
Deut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings
6:2&29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenant
breakers is real.

The ""I"" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The ""we"" of the Psalms
includes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not our
own, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. The
Psalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They record
Christ's march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. As
Christ is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the final
fulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God will
answer the psalmist's prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the
final day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day when
He will say: ""But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be
King over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me""
Luke 19:27.

A fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to
obey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these war
psalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God's
kingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by
the kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each local
congregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally your
battalion to put on the whole armour of God, including ""the sword
of the Spirit, which is the Word of God "" Eph 6:17. That battle-
readiness also involves ""pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasions
with all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18.

Christ teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the
enemies of God as the psalmist did: ""Pour out Your wrath on the
nations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not
call on Your Name"" Ps 79:6.

To deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it
is necessary for us to pray for God's justice. Those who are
persecuted need the comfort of these prayers.

""Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May the
praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in
their hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment
on the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles
with shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against
them. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. "" Ps
149:5-9

Prayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer for
conversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgement
on those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the army
of God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that He
has given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the people
nf God to destroy evil.

If you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting or
undermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your sword
anew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory of
Jesus - until ""the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as
the waters cover the sea"" Hab 2:14.

2) Drawing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional screen.

The simple answer is, you divide by the depth.  For a more verbose
explanation, see any of the above references, starting with:

The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes ""Computer Graphics"" book is certainly
a good start.  Chapter 6 is ""Viewing in 3D"", then read chapter 15,
""Visible-Surface Determination"".  For more information go to chapter 16 for
shading, chapter 19 for clipping, and branch out from there.


3) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits.

Find a copy of ""Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display"" by
Paul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings, page 297.  There are other
algorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations
are included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).

A variant method is described in ""Graphics Gems"", p. 287-293.  Note that
the code from the ""Graphics Gems"" series is all available from an FTP site,
as described above.

Check out John Bradley's ""Diversity Algorithm"", which is incorporated into
the xv package and described in the back of the manual.

The ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another
quantizing algorithm which is presented as ""doing a better job than the
other algorithms, but slower"".

There's also an implementation of:

Wan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data
Clustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988),
pp. 153-162.

avialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code,
in modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.


4) Converting color into grayscale.

The NTSC formula is:

    luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue


5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.

The only reference you need for this stuff is:

    Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6

But before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation
software mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do
some form of gray to b&w conversion.


6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.

The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source
image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.
This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,
loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*
transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.
This method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one
2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing
sub-pixel sampling.

However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,
which involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally
created for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is
also present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: ""A Fast Algorithm for Raster
Rotation"", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics
Interface '86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in
the same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears
in ""Graphics Gems"" (see section [1]) under the original title.


7) Free image manipulation software.

There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to
another, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus
the above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.
Here are pointers to some of them:

    xv by John Bradley.  X-based image display, manipulation, and format
    conversion package.  XV displays many image formats and permits editing
    of GIF files, among others. The program was updated 5/92; see the file
    contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

    PBMPLUS, by Jef Poskanzer.  Comprehensive format conversion and image
    manipulation package.  The latest version is always available via
    anonymous FTP as ftp.ee.lbl.gov:pbmplus*.tar.Z,
    wuarchive.wustl.edu:graphics/graphics/packages/pbmplus/pbmplus*.tar.Z,
    and export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/pbmplus*.tar.Z.

    IM Raster Toolkit, by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.uwaterloo.ca).
    Provides a portable and efficient format and related toolkit.  The
    format is versatile in supporting pixels of arbitrary channels,
    components, and bit precisions while allowing compression and machine
    byte-order independence.  The kit contains more than 50 tools with
    extensive support of image manipulation, digital halftoning and format
    conversion.  Previously distributed on tape c/o the University of
    Waterloo, an FTP version will appear someday.

    Utah RLE Toolkit.  Conversion and manipulation package, similar to
    PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*,
    princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.

    Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.
    Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0
    available via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z,
    ftp.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.

    Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>.  Reads and
    writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some
    image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP as
    export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, and
    venera.isi.edu:pub/img_1.3.tar.Z along with a large collection of color
    images.

    Xim, X Image Manipulator, by Philip R. Thompson.  It does essential
    interactive image manipulations and uses x11r4 and the OSF/Motif toolkit
    for the interface.  It supports images in 1, 8, 24 and 32 bit formats.
    Reads/writes and converts to/from GIF, xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, and
    other formats.  Writes level 2 postscript.  Other utilities and image
    application library are included.  Not a paint package.  Available via
    ftp from gis.mit.edu.

    xloadimage, by Jim Frost <madd@std.com>.  Reads in images in various
    formats and displays them on an X11 screen.  Available via FTP as
    export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xloadimage*, and in your nearest comp.sources.x
    archive.

    xli, by Grame Gill, is an updated xloadimage with numerous improvements
    in both speed and in the number of formats supported.  Available in the
    same places as xloadimage (contrib tape, comp.sources.x archives).

    TIFF Software, by Sam Leffler <sam@okeeffe.berkeley.edu>.  Nice
    portable library for reading and writing TIFF files, plus a few tools
    for manipulating them and reading other formats.  Available via FTP as
    ucbvax.berkeley.edu:pub/tiff/*.tar.Z or ftp.uu.net:graphics/tiff.tar.Z

    xtiff, an X11 tool for viewing a TIFF file.  It was written to handle
    as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining
    simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems
    with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is
    distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also
    available on export.lcs.mit.edu, ftp.uu.net and comp.sources.x.
    xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.

    ALV, a Sun-specific image toolkit.  Version 2.0.6 posted to
    comp.sources.sun on 11dec89.  Also available via email to
    alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk.

    popi, an image manipulation language.  Version 2.1 posted to
    comp.sources.misc on 12dec89.

    ImageMagick, an X11 package for display and interactive manipulation
    of images.  Includes tools for image conversion, annotation, compositing,
    animation, and creating montages.  ImageMagick can read and write many of
    the more popular image formats.  Available via FTP as
    export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.

    Khoros, a huge (~100 meg) graphical development environment based on
    X11R4.  Khoros components include a visual programming language, code
    generators for extending the visual language and adding new application
    packages to the system, an interactive user interface editor, an
    interactive image display package, an extensive library of image and
    signal processing routines, and 2D/3D plotting packages.  Available via
    FTP as pprg.eece.unm.edu:pub/khoros/*.

    LaboImage, a SunView-based image processing and analysis package.  It
    includes more than 200 image manipulation, processing and measurement
    routines, on-line help, plus tools such as an image editor, a color
    table editor and several biomedical utilities.  Available via anonymous
    FTP as ads.com:pub/VISION-LIST-ARCHIVE/SHAREWARE/LaboImage_3.1.tar.Z

    The San Diego Supercomputer Center Image Tools, software tools for
    reading, writing, and manipulating raster images.  Binaries for some
    machines available via anonymous FTP in sdsc.edu:sdscpub.

Please do *not* post or mail messages saying ""I can't FTP, could someone
mail this to me?""  There are a number of automated mail servers that will
send you things like this in response to a message.  See item 13 below for
details on some.

Also, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion
of software like this.  You may find useful information there.


8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.

You almost certainly don't need these.  Read the above item 7 on free
image manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and
look through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you
were going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the
format documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from
zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.

These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.
This archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object
formats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark
Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.

A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained
by Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently,
neither of these is complete, you might want to check both.

FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It's a file format most
often used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images
but other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and
information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.



9) Converting between vector formats.

A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw
to CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very
different problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting
one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you
get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects
are the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.
The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled
round-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.
Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do
a one-to-one conversion between vector formats.

There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The
contributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.
A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.

On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,
rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.
As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such
converters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been
posted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive
site.

A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format
to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to
X11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for
PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,
the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11/NeWs can
be used to render to a file if you're clever.  But in general, the
answer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to
vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be
trivial.

GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes
drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as
a PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements
essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript
and level 2).


10) How to get Pixar films.

The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available
on video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:

    Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price
    Luxo, Jr.				$14.95			$50.00
    Red's Dream				$19.95			$75.00
    Tin Toy				$24.95			$75.00
    Knickknack				$24.95			$75.00
    Luxo, Jr./Red's Dream/Tin Toy	$39.95			$100.00

All tapes are on 1/2"" VHS NTSC.  Add $10/tape for PAL format.  Also
available:

    Tin Toy T-shirt			$15.00
    Knickknack 3D T-shirt		$15.00 (includes glasses)

For individual orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape or shirt, $2 for
each additional tape or shirt.  For institutional orders, add $5 S&H
for the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping, add
$3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international,
213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify
prices and availability.  Or, just write to:

    Direct Cinema Limited
    1749 14th Street
    Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342

Allan Braunsdorf has this to say:

At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts
for $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly
more than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it's
available from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar's address).

    Pixar
    1001 West Cutting Blvd.
    Richmond, CA. 94804
    (510) 236-4000 
    (510) 236-0388 (FAX)

You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains ""Luxo, Jr."", ""Red's
Dream"", ""Tin Toy"" and ""Knicknack"" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. They
will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I 
ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don't expect 
to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license
agreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.


11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?

The short answer is, ""You can't.""  Unless you use a rational spline you
can only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable,
but it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of
approximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not
visible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to
do the job right, consult the article:

  ""A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles""
  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller
  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,
  September, 1989, pages 48-56.

For rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:

  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture
  by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,
  Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.

For the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:

  ""Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves""
  by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken
  in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),
  June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]


12) How to order standards documents.

The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also
ISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,
mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the
complete name and number.

Some useful numbers to know:

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical
Kernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer's Hierarchical
Interactive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI
Y14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;
for example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.

Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit
comments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let
you know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering
at 1-800-854-7179.


13) How to FTP by email.

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"",
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying ""help"" and it will tell you how to use
it.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.


14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.

Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to
infinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,
the point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of
edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior
hole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in
the trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article in
Glassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including
treatment of special cases.

Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all
the vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,
if the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an
order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the
trigonometric functions is usually quite costly.

Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in
the Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:
pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.


15) How to tessellate a sphere.

One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The
base of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides
each triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu>
has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates.
It's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.

16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.

Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:

Highlights of this edition-

    i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through
       November '91;
    ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG
        International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, '91;
    iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;
    iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;
    v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.

The bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long.
Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It's named
""speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z"" and is compressed at most sites-

             Site                             Dir
	wuarchive.wustl.edu	graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/
	karazm.math.uh.edu	pub/Graphics/
	gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au	pub/papers/
	nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/graphics
	coral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/

Eric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global
illumination bibliographies.  These are in ""refer"" format, and so can be
searched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is
included with each).  The bibliographies are available at most of the
sites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained at
princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/Papers as ""RayBib.*"" and ""RadBib.*"".

Tom Wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray
tracing related research papers and books.  The information is essentially
in plaintext, and Latex and troff formatting programs are included.  This
collection is available at most of the sites above as ""rtabs.*"".

17) SIGGRAPH information online

[from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick]

ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at  siggraph.org
(128.248.245.250).  This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both
anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.

The anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includes
both conference and publications subdirectories.

To retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to
     archive-server@siggraph.org
and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send
followed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is with
the command
     send index
which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.


18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available

[from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]

ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH '91 Panels Proceedings
at the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are available
in three formats:
     text   (ASCII)
     rtf    (rich text format, suitable for many word processors)
     word   (MS Word for the Macintosh)
They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:

(1) by anonymous ftp
    change to one of the directories
       publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]
    The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word
    files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary 
    mode.

    Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the
    contents of each panel file.

(2) by electronic mail
    send mail to
       archive-server@siggraph.org
    You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.  We suggest that you
    first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages
       send panel91-txt index
       send panel91-rtf index
    in the subject or body of the message.  You will get the necessary
    information to retrieve the actual transcript files.


19) Graphics mailing lists

There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, each
covering either a single product or a single topic.  I have been an
active participant in one of these for some time now, and find the
focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic
to be nothing short of amazing.

Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you
would like to see added.

20) Specific references on file formats

    Graphics File Formats, David Kay and John Levine, Windcrest/McGraw-Hill
      1992, ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 paper, ISBN 0-8306-3060-0 $36.95 hardcover,
      ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 $24.95 paper.  Comments - 26 formats, no software
      (this is good, IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent).
      Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.


21) What about GIF?

GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.  It is portable and usable upon
a wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the
keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don't like
it much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question
which was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list
of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.

Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info
Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info
Newsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc,
	alt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,
	alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers

Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from
pit-manager.mit.edu in the files:

/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1
/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2

Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail
message containing any or all of:

send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1
send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2

Send a message containing ""help"" to get general information about the
mail server.

Also, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and
20 above for more information.


22) What is morphing?

Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new
location. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.
Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and
morphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au
in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:

        morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)
        morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)
        m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)

The files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and
uncompress them afterwards.


23) How to ray-trace height fields

Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses,
such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they
get their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be
located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.

The following paper seems to be the definitive reference:

F. Kenton Musgrave
Grid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields
July, 1988
<musg88.ps.Z>

This is available as ""Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639"" from Yale University,
it's also in the SIGGRAPH '91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and
Imaging course notes, and (best of all) it's available on the net:

    nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.Z
    weedeater.math.yale.edu	pub/Papers/musg88.ms.Z
    princeton.edu		pub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z
    coral.cs.jcu.edu.au		graphics/papers/musg88.ps.Z
    gondwana.ecr.mu.OZ.AU	pub/papers/musg88.ms.Z and musg88.ps.Z

An implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade.

Another paper exists:

%A David W. Paglieroni
%A Sidney M. Petersen
%T Parametric Height Field Ray Tracing
%J Proceedings of Graphics Interface '92
%I Canadian Information Processing Society
%C Toronto, Ontario

24) How to find the area of a 3D polygon

	The area of a triangle is given by (in C notation),

     area = 0.5 * ( ( x[0] * y[1] ) + ( x[1] * y[2] ) + ( x[2] * y[0] ) -
	            ( x[1] * y[0] ) - ( x[2] * y[1] ) - ( x[0] * y[2] ) );

and the area of a planar polygon is given by

     area = 0.0;

     for ( i = 0; i < n - 1; i++ )
         area += ( x[i] * y[i + 1] ) - ( x[i + 1] * y[i] );
     area += ( x[n - 1] * y[0] ) - ( x[0] * y[n - 1] );
     area /= 2.0;

If the area is a negative number, the polygon or triangle is
clockwise, if positive, it is counterclockwise.

>From Ronald Golman's Gem (in Graphics Gems II - see section 1 above), ""Area
 of Planar Polygons and Volume of Polyhedra:""

The area of a polygon P0, P1, P2, ... Pn, not in the x-y plane, is
given by

     Area(Polygon) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk+1 } |

where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal
vertex.  The . represents the dot product operator and the x
represents the cross product operator.  Sigma represents the summation
operator.  | | represents the absolute value operator.  Pn+1 is equal
to P0.


25) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPH

Probably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your
local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM.
Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank.
Fill it out and mail it in.  ACM membership for students costs $23.00,
Voting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly)

SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 for
Voting or Associate Members (also yearly).  To get TOG (Transactions
on Graphics) it's another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for Voting or
Associate Members.

If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM, it'll cost you
$59.00 (no student discount).

There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications.

ACM Member services may be contacted via email at acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet. 
Their phone number is (212) 626-0500.  FAX number (212) 944-1318.

David, this study looks like a good one.  Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline 
search and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since 
commercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or 
bulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative.
This is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are 
recommended rather than yogurt.

I guess the next question is why would this introduction of ""good"" bacteria 
back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the 
anus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy
denys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a 
facultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and 
colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain 
the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion 
was stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the 
intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida 
looses it's major food source.

Getting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is 
normally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal 
yeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has 
been used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in 
the medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting 
their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their 
patients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if 
ever published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age 
emerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the 
medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to 
help patients or does it look the other way.

This particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous 
therapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But 
there are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty 
hot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow only 
well established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or 
do it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to 
work yet?

My stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they 
involve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back into 
the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The other 
is getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a 
problem with recurring yeast infections.

If I'm going to drive on a public road then I need a
speedometer, and an odometer helps for navigation.
 
My 1965 Chevy has a bare minimum:  Engine-temp and
Oil-press warning lights and a fuel gauge. 

My 1983 VW has tach, water-temp, voltmeter 
and oil-temp gauges. 
 
If I had a turbo car, I'd want a vacuum manifold/boost
gauge.  An oil pressure gauge is a nice, reassuring
gauge to look at.  If my car was air cooled, then I
would substitute a cyl-head-temp gauge for the water-temp
gauge.
 
A few years ago, I looked at the Audi Quattro Si Coupe
that Bobby Unser used to win the 1986 Pikes Peak Hill Climb.
The gauge layout, from left to right, top to bottom was:

I wrote that I thought that 2 Peter 1:20 meant, ""no prophecy of

merely the private opinion of the writer.""

Tony Zamora replies (Sat 8 May 1993) that this in turn implies that
it is not subject to the private interpretation of the reader
either. I am not sure that I understand this.
     In one sense, no statement by another is subject to my private
interpretation. If reliable historians tell me that the Athenians
lost the Pelopennesian War, I cannot simply interpret this away
because I wanted the Athenians to win. Facts are facts and do not go
away because I want them to be otherwise.
     In another sense, every statement is subject to private
interpretation, in that I have to depend on my brains and
expereience to decide what it means, and whether it is sufficiently
well attested to merit my assent. Even if the statement occurs in an
inspired writing, I still have to decide, using my own best
judgement, whether it is in fact inspired. This is not arrogance --
it is just an inescapable fact.

Before becoming a Christian I too had problems when I asked one to explain
it to me...The actual evidence is not always what you see on a person's 
outside. It should be but is not always.
	A very specific, somewhat miraculous example of the truth of God
working to help His followers is soemthing that happened to me. For nearly
4 years after an accident I had severe complications from a triple 
fracture in my left leg and surgery--pins put in, then removed. The bone 
itself was perfectly healed. No infectoin that could be detected. Yet I 
was in constant pain and it my ankle and foot were always swollen and
bluish. More complicatios developed in my other leg, none of which could
be explained by the best specialists and most sophisticated tests in te
northern Illinois region. We went everywhere--no one could explain it.
Durin gthat summer (June 19, 1991 to be exact) I gave my life and heart
to Christ and vowed to relinquish control over my life (which i never
really had anyway) because of what he did for me on the cross and the 
fact that my whole life was screwed up by me trying to fix it. I was facing
the possibility of a lifetime in a wheelchair (I was confined to one in 
order to save my legs from any further damage since the cause of my problems
were unknown, had been in it for about 2 1/2 months before that day).
	I found it ore than coincidental that less than 2 weeks after
I put my faith where my mouth was, one more in the long line of doctors
and not even an orthopeodic specialist, diagnosed my problems with no
difficulty, set me on the path to an effective cure, and I was walking
and running again without the pain that had stopped me from that for
4 years. The diagnosis was something he felt the other doctors must have
""overlooked"" because it was perfectly obvious from my test results.
	Maybe this doesn't hit you as miraculous. But to me it really
is. Imagine an active 17 year old being told she may not be able to
walk mcuh longer...and is now a happy 18 year old who can dance and run
knowing that the problem was there all along and was ""revealed"" just
after she did what she knew was right. As the song says...
	""Our God is an awesome God....""

The problem is that the process is inherently complicated ! The IJG's code is
pretty good if you ask me, and I have watched it go through many many cycles of
revision.

Try getting a good book on the subject, that will explain the algorithms.

Specifically ""JPEG Still Image Compression Standard"" by Pennebaker & Mitchell,
VNR 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.

BTW. I presume your comment about ""good"" code wasn't meant to sound as offensive

Putting aside our substantial differences, I'd like to ask the knowledgeable
ones to give feedback on this.  Let me explain.

One of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after
having some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old).
Otherwise, she is in fine health.  The discovery was made via CAT scans.

She then had MRI scans done, where small cancerous areas were discovered
in her lungs.  Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma.  One spot is
in the lungs, and another in the pneumothorax.  The oncologists believe
the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked
until four years ago).

Anyway, I'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is, how it is different
from other cancers, how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is right
below the skull and can be easily removed), and statistically what are
the chances for full remission/recovery?

Thanks.

    I don't remember the formula's off hand as it has been awhile since
I took aerodynamics and haven't used the stuff since. 
The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and
fuel consumption. When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater
than what the vehicle's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed.
(autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance)
Since drag opposes the vehicle's motion, the engine must make up for that
by burning more fuel. Anyway, since the geometery of an auto is rather
complex, the Drag,pressure coeffiecent,etc is either found experimentaly, or
using a numerical method.

anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is:

            Cd = d/(q*2R)

       where d is the drag force, q the flow velocity and R is the radius
of the clyinder.
   To get a rough (very rough) estimate, you can set R at 1/2 the car's
width, q at the car's speed and knowing the Cd, find the drag force that
the car would need to overcome.

to me. I thought the emergency brake on most cars only affected the rear

What you call ""the Trinity and the Catholic church's definition
of it"" is precisely the result of the first Christians getting
together and trying to find an acceptable answer to your
question ""what is a Christian?"". I can't see what you are
objecting to: someone is saying what historians of all beliefs
would agree on, and you are calling him a closed-minded bigot?

You really ought to say what you mean by ""belief in Jesus
Christ"". It is not a wording that is sufficient to describe a
Christian. Muslims believe in Jesus Christ although they
believe he was a prophet and not the incarnated Son of God. But
followers of Eastern religions might be quite happy to say that
Jesus was the incarnation of God - along with large numbers of
other historical and mythical figures.

So perhaps you ought to rephrase your question and say
precisely what it is in the traditional definitions of what it
is to be a Christian, as handed down by the Universal Church,
you object to but regard as unnecessary for being a Christian.

Yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bulgaricus.  L. 
acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily 
responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of 
the commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. 
bulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are 
much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told 
me through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several 
different obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't 
told me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative 
anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a 
chance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria 
around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal 
region or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida 
blooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from 
the evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do 
believe that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower 
colon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the 
competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.
Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get 
rid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A 
supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the 
good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the 
pH to basically starve the candida out.

I would add 4': our churches should accept homosexual orientation but hold all
people to certain standards of sexual behavior.  Promiscuity, abuse of power
relationships, harrassment, compulsivity are equally out of place in the lives
of homosexual as of heterosexual people.

Several replies to my post have said that I should get to know

but I know that many are from their e-mail responces).  I don't  
normally make sterotypical assumptions about groups of people, but  
since I have been asked to by many of the opposing veiw point I will.

So far people have made wild assumptions, put me down because I don't

From a long article Available through an individual on this newsgroup.

About scripture being against homosexuality:
------------------------------------------
When we  are
less homophobic we will see that what we know as gay and lesbian  people,
engaging in loving, voluntary erotic relations with each other, aren't  even
mentioned. [in the Bible, tk]
------------------------------------------

This frightens me (not in the homophobic sense, but intellectually),
especially because it was written by someone from a homosexual church.

So, if my interpretation is different than theirs, I am homophobic!  This
can't be right. Disagreement in interpretation of the Bible and/or rejection
of homosexual acts is not tantamount of homophobia.

Subject: Dreams and out of body incidents
Lines: 38

hey folks,

I'm fairly new to these groups, tho' some have heard from me before.

I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a
lot:  What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents?
In normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously
you aren't morally responsible for your actions.  But if you can contrive
to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.

Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives:

1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality
applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying
to think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent
thoughts.

2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')
Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in
common by more than one person.  A
mark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.
In this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and
OOBEs as does in waking life.

3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a
real existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe 
different) moral laws apply there.

So... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know
of another alternative?  respond by post or email.

thanks very much

If that's the ONLY reason, I'd be inclined to doubt whether or not what
they profess is Christianity.  The relationship of faith is based upon
trust.  Fear and trust are generally incompatible.  If my only motivation
is fear, is there room for trust?  If so, there's room for faith.  
If fear precludes trust, then there can't be faith.

Here is a press release from the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees.

 Unions Point To Deadly Workplaces; AFSCME, Other Unions
Commemorate Workers Memorial Day
 To: National Desk, Labor Writer
 Contact: Janet Rivera of the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, 202-429-1130

   WASHINGTON, April 23 -- The American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and other unions
of the AFL-CIO on Wednesday, April 28, will commemorate the fifth
annual Workers Memorial Day -- a day to pay homage to the 6
million workers who are killed, injured, or diseased on the job.
   This year, AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts an
the dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work.
Earlier this month, an AFSCME corrections officer, Robert
Vallandingham, was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections
facility in Lucasville, Ohio.
   The law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steady
increase in the prison population for the past five years.  On
Jn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections
show a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an
expected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.
   The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has
created for corrections officers is partially reflected in the
number of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against
staff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain
high.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff,
compared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.
   The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous
combination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio
officer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in
the nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and
safety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis
B, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.
   AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation's
federal, state and local correctional facilities.
   Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under
life-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workers
die from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from
occupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation's
most dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:

   -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and
      frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are
      not barricaded or don't have proper lighting.
   -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of
      job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector
      employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more
      than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private
      sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the
      previous year.  It is generally believed that health care
      workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes
      have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses
      than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety
      issues facing health care workers include exposure to
      tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high
      levels of stress.
   -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health
      institutions are often the victims of assaults and,
      sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man
      carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler
      County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.
      and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the
      gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a
      growing lack of support services for people who don't have
      the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some
      clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.
      Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.
      The ""quality"" of the clients is also becoming more violent,
      as more are moved out of the institutions.

   Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards
since OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W.
McEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety
protections for public employees.
   ""More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the
job, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA
coverage for public employees,"" said McEntee.  ""This, despite the
fact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers,
corrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most
dangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for
passage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater
rights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees
safe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful.""
   Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private
sector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more
severe.
   Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed
in 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states
have no OSHA coverage.

There are two different mechanisms here:  toning of muscles and reduction of
fat.  Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles
exercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching
arms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However, if exercise
also leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally
distributed over the entire body.  There is no way to ""spot reduce"" body fat
other than surgically, through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is
genetically determined.  Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like ""fat"",
so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the ""fat""
is ""changing"" into ""muscle"", but really fat and muscle tissues are totally
separate, and one does not ever ""change into"" the other.

There is no reason to believe that Paul's thorn in the flesh was 
a sin in his life.  That makes little sense in the light of Paul'
writings taken in totality.  He writes of how he presses for the
mark, and keeps his body submitted.  No doubt Paul had to struggle
with the flesh just like every Christian.  Paul does associate his 
thorn with a Satanic messenger, and with physical infirmities and tribulation,
but not with a sin in his life.

Well, the 1.6 IS music to my ears. I often turn my stereo off and just run
it towards red line on nice twisty roads. But Toyota engines at idle have
a strange ""bells and whisstles at the bottom of a matal can"" sound. I can't

Just like all the older Benzes have a very characteristic clattering sound
at idle. Do you know what I'm referring to?

I don't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist.
No scientist would take your statement --- ""no convincing empirical evidence
to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome"" --- to tell you
anything except an absence of data on the question.  Noring has pointed out
the catch-22 that if the ""crazy"" theory were true, you probably couldn't
find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie
beasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the
fellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set
of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---
namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,
many of them appear to get better.  

So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,
controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any
better than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we
have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject
disbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling
back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any
convincing evidence either positive or negative.  

And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of
people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything
in sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do
controlled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently
sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working
on themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also
quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's
completely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine
scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting
oxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that
doesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's some
other reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be
true, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people
have been talking about.

But again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal
evidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some
candida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,
it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can
marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough
manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind
study of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out
the test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can
adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study
should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.

I am reluctant to summarize it, for then you will have my opinion of what the
article says, rather than your own opinion.  I think it is important enough
for you to take the trouble to go to the library and get the article.  The
title is ""The shot doctors"" and it appears on Pages 96-100 of the February,
1988 issue of Consumer Reports.  The following excerpt from the article may
entice you to read the whole article:

To the people who wrote the Bible and to whom the Bible is written,
there is evidence of love, but that is a cultural bias. This is
a poor answer which you needn't rebut.

I will now pull the old bait and switch.

I think you should use the Bible to judge man, not God.
By that I mean, if your moral intuition doesn't like what
is described in the Bible, realize that such things are going on
now. I will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of evil
and ask what are you doing to fight it? Not you specifically,
but everyone, including myself. If I don't like the genocide
in the Bible, what about the genocide that goes on right now?
To move beyond the question of a hell, realize that many people
right now are suffering. If you think hell isn't fair and are
willing to sacrifice everything just to deny its existence,
what about how life isn't fair? Right now there is a young mother
with three little kids who doesn't know how she will get through
the day. Right now there is a sixth grader who is a junkie.
Right now there is an old man with no friends and no money to
fix his TV. Instead of why doesn't God help them ask why don't
we help them. I think you are correct to challenge any Christian
who doesn't live his life with the compassion you seem to possess.

You want evidence of God. Find someone who is making a difference,
someone you admire, someone who has been through some tough times
and has come out with his head up. Ask the person how he does it. Ask 
the Vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind. Ask the 
woman who was pregnant at 15, kept the baby and now is a successful
business woman. Ask the doctor who has operated on a 1-1/2 pound
baby. They won't all be Christians, or even what you might
call religious, but there will be something in common.

God is not defined in the Bible, God is defined by what is
in those people's hearts. It doesn't matter if you can't give
intellectual assent to any description you've heard, they're
all wrong anyway. The compassion you already feel in your heart 
is a step in the right direction. Follow that instead.
Then come back and read the Bible and you'll see that same
thing described there.

I hate to sound flippant, having shot off my mouth badly on the net
before, but I'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my
feeling that ""the assumption of Mary"" would be better phrased ""our
assumptions _about_ Mary.""  In all the time I've been reading about
Mary on this group, I can not recall reading much about Mary that
did not sound like wishful veneration with scant, if any, Scriptural
foundation.  

I find in the New Testament a very real portrait of Christ's parents
as compellingly human persons; to be honored and admired for their
humility and submission to God's working, beyond doubt.  But the almalga-
mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me
an image of alien and inhuman creatures, untouched by sin or human
desire.  Only Christ himself was so truly sanctified, and even He knew
temptation, albeit without submitting to it.

I also don't see the _necessity_ of saying the Holy Parents were some-
how sanctified beyond normal humanity: it sounds like our own inability
to grasp the immensity of God's grace in being incarnated through an or-
dinary human being.  

I won't start yelling about how people are ""worshipping"" Mary, etc.,
since folks have told me otherwise about that, but I do think we
lose part of the wonder of God's Incarnation in Christ when we make
his parents out to be sinless, sexless, deathless, otherworldly beings.

Subject: Baptism requires Faith
Organization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Lines: 144

It troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support
the doctrine of Original Sin.  This is primarily a Catholic doctrine, with no
other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism.  Even among, its
supporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants
will go to hell.

It's very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of
scripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine.  However, if we have the
heart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically
based, then we can come to an understanding of the truth.  Let's now take a
more complete look at scripture.

Colossians 2:11-12 ""In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of
the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having been
buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the
power of God, who raised him from the dead.""

In baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through a
personal faith in the power of God.  Our parent's faith cannot do this.  Do
infants have faith?  Let's look at what the Bible has to say about it.

Romans 10:16-17 ""But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For
Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faith
comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word
of Christ.""

So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the
gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids
are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to
respond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot
be raised in baptism to a new life.

Ezekiel 18:20 ""The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the
guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The
righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the
wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.""

If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty
for anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.

Ezekiel 18:31-32 ""Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted,
and get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel?
For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.
Repent and live!""

The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kids
cannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we
will then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live.

Now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is
not Biblical, let's look at some of the scriptures used to support it.

Romans 5:12 ""Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and
death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all
sinned--""

Sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came to
each man because each man sinned.  Note that it's good to read through all
of Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than
others, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all
saying basically the same thing.  Let's look at one such.

Romans 5:19 ""For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many
were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many
will be made righteous.""

Through the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.  In
the same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous.
We must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each
man only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam.
Otherwise the Bible would contradict itself.  I encourage you to read
through this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point of
view to see if it doesn't all fit together.

Psalm 51:5 ""Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother
conceived me.""

This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves
before God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after God's
own heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and
murdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he can't
remember a time when he wasn't sinful.  He is humbling himself before God
by confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth is
a hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn't limited to a literal
interpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25).
For another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.

Now then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and that
original sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism is
necessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with
other children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc.

Certainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feeling
is always that they don't know any better.  Let's look to see if the Bible
agrees with my gut feelings.

Isaiah 7:14-15 ""Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  The
virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him
Immanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the
wrong and choose the right.""

Now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy
about Jesus.  If they don't, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a new
leader.  Jesus certainly couldn't have had less knowledge than normal human
babies.  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent
before he would know the difference between right and wrong.  We see that
he did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The implication is
that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over
wrong.  Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have rather
conclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don't know to choose
the right instead of the wrong.

Jesus himself was baptized, albeit with John's baptism, not as an infant,
but as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry as
soon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23).  Immediately afterwards, he was
tempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13).

Thank you for your attention.

[I think you're overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of
your response.  First, original sin is not a Catholic-only doctrine.
It was held by Luther and Calvin as well, and is still present in one
form or another in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions.  Second,
saying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is
an ad hominem argument, which has considerable evidence against it.
The original Baptist theology included original sin, and some Baptists
still hold it.  And there are certainly groups that baptize infants
without believing in original sin.  Among Protestants, the sacraments
tend to be a bit more symbolic than among Catholics.  Protestants who
baptize infants see baptism as a sign of God's acceptance of us,
rather than our acceptance of God.  In traditional Protestant
theology, God's grace precedes our response, and is applicable to
children.  There are a number of passages one can cite to indicate
that God accepts even children.  --clh]

Maybe. I've had an Epson portable with backlit LCD since 1988 which is
still used daily and the screen on that is fine. The only problem it
has (and ever has had) is the ""arm"" of the screen is sorta lose and if
you bend it fairly harshly the screen goes off until you wiggle it
round a bit. But other than that, it's been perfect! So what's that,
about um, 60 months???!

You should remember that in Adam's transgression, all men and women
sinned, as Paul wrote.  All of humanity cooperativley reblled against
God in Adma's sin, thus, all are subject to it, and the sin is
transmitted from generation to generation.

Hi sci.med folks...

I would like to know anything you folks can tell me regarding Lithium.

I have a 10 year old son that lives with my ex-wife.  She has been having
difficulty with his behavior and has had him on Ritalin, Tofranil, and now
wants to try Lithuim at the local doctors suggestion.  I would like to 
know whatever is important that I should know.  I worry about this sort of
thing and would like pros/cons regarding Lithium therapy.

I have a booklet from the ""Lithium Information Center"" based at the 
University of Wisconsin, but feel that it is pro-lithium and would be
interested in comments from the ""not necessarily PRO"" side of the fence.

I am a concerned father and just wish to be well informed...

Thanks for any information you can provide.

Please email me directly...

while it's being mentioned, i personally prefer the moonroof/sunroof/t-top/
targa thing as well.  I simply don't like cloth tops, nor the extra insurance,
nor the S**** color matching alot of companies do.  If i chose a convertible,
it'd be:

a) Mazda RX7 II.  I just like the way they look.  It'd have to be in black,
with color matched black top(they look good!)

b) VW cabriolet.  They do a suberb job of matching colors too.  Also, last year
for them!  {***COLLECTOR'S ITEM****}

c) mustang GT droptop...they look ok too.

i know this doesn't help, but i thought i'd do it anyway...:-)

Yes, but Jesus also made a very general and doctrinal statement
in the same conversation:

""Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.""
(John 3:6)

Clearly infants are not born of the spirit.  Thus, without baptism
they are unspiritual.  They are not born with the image of God, but in
Adam's fallen image (cf. Gen 5:3).  They have no righteousness of
their own, just as adults have no righteousness of their own.  There
is only the imputed righteousness of Christ, which believers receive
through faith.

Alan> 3.  We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even introduce the
Alan> concept of spiritual re-birth through baptism if newborn babies
Alan> weren't free from sin?

Your point is a little obscure here, but I think you are saying
that Christ used the ""innocence"" of newborn babes as a metaphor
for spiritual re-birth.  But this is not what he did.
If you look at the text, he did not speak
of spiritual re-birth but of spiritual birth.  We are
born of the Spirit once, not twice or several times.
We are also born of the flesh once.  The Lord makes it
clear that these are separate and different events.
It is true that other Scriptures refer to spiritual
birth as re-birth because it is a second birth
(for example, Titus 3:5).  But it is not a second
*spiritual* birth.

The only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth,
which is used as a symbol of `new life' -- not of innocence.  When an
infant is born (or conceived) a new life is begun--but it is neither
innocent nor righteous.  Similarly when that same individual is
baptized, or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism, they begin a
new life in Christ (Romans 6:3, Colossians 2:12, Titus 3:5, Ephesians
2:5).  Then the believer has God's assurance of the forgiveness of
their sins, and of Christ's imputed righteousness.

In fact my first clue that this was a Stanza was that the owners manual

sin.  However...

>Does Jesus need

>Jesus when he says he can forgive any sin?

A big part of the problem is that many of the homosexuals and people
advocating acceptance of homosexuality in churches do not consider
(active) homosexuality a sin.  I don't often see the attitude of
""forgive me and I will try to change"".  Instead I see ""there's nothing
wrong with my life and I can be a good Christian, so it must be you who
have an illness because you don't accept me"".  Christians can and will
accept homosexuals, just as they will accept *any* sinner.

Sure, it may be natural to some people to be homosexual - but it
is also perfectly natural for everyone to sin!  I was born with
a desire to sin, but I work to prevent myself from sinning.  It's
much less common now, but I *still* have urges to lash out in
anger.  There also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful
desires (or ever!), so it is sad to see people leave the church
when they are discouraged that they are still homosexual after
several years.

       I just had my rotors on my '92 Taurus GL changed less than 500 miles

   :-(  I had a mechanic friend of mine look at it and he said that there is a

   rotor bought from a Ford Dealership.  Can't they even produce a brand new
   rotor that is not warped?  I'm currently negotiating with them to swap it
   out for a new rotor.

       This is my first American build car and I'm not overly impressed.

If you can get the live animation and the computer-generated animation

this for you.  It can take one animation, make a certain color

Until recently I always understood the term ""kingdom theology"" to mean the 
theology of the kingdom of God, but now I have discovered that there is a 
new and more specialized meaning. I gather that it is also called ""Dominion 
theology"", and that it has to do with a belief that Christians must create a 
theocratic form of government on earth before Christ will come again.

I have not come across anyone who believes or advocates this, but I am told 
that it is a very widespread belief in the USA.

Can anyone give me any more information about it?

   Yes, Mary is fully human.  However, that does not imply that she was
just as subject to sin as we are.  Catholic doctrine says that man's
nature is good (Gen 1:31), but is damaged by Original Sin (Rom 5:12-16).
In that case, being undamaged by Original Sin, Mary is more fully human
than any of the rest of us.

   You ask why God cannot ""repeat the miracle"" of Mary's preservation
from Original Sin.  A better way to phrase it would be ""why _did_ He
not"" do it that way, but you misunderstand how Mary's salvation was
obtained.  Like ours, the Blessed Virgin Mary's salvation was obtained
through the merits of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross.  However, as
God is not bound by time, which is His creation, God is free to apply
His Sacrifice to anyone at any time, even if that person lived before
Christ came to Earth, from our time-bound perspective.  Therefore,
Christ's Death and Resurrection still served a necessary purpose, and
were necessary even for Mary's salvation.

Yes, it will still be on the fox program chasis, anything that will be different

likely be changed, as well as the drive drain. From what has been printed on
it, there is no clear idea of what will be done, as some say it will have

Yes, this is a common and safe procedure.  The majority of Schatzki's
rings described by x-ray, however, wnd up being due to inflammation
instead of the congenital Schatzki's ring.  Occassionally a cancer
masquerades as a ring.  You should have the endoscopy to see if it
is due to the heartburn, and if so, you will need treatment for the
heartburn ong term.  The balloon dilation is an alternative to cutting
open your chest and cutting out a section of the esophagus, so dilation
is not at all invasive, considering the alternative.

I' not an expert on heart problems, but PVC's are common and have been
overtreated in the past.  My personal experience, and I have the same 
history an build you do (related to the heart, that is), is that my PVC's
come and go, with some months causing anxiety.  Taking on more fluids
seems to help, and they seem worse in the summer.  Remember that a slow 
heart rate will allow more PVC's to be apparent, so perhaps it is an 
indication of a healthy cardiac system (but ask an expert about that
last point, especially)

Good luck, hope we don't die of arrhythmias.  (God, what a happy thought)

In the past few years I have owned 3 Mustang GTs and now own a 91 T-Bird SC. 
They all have had this problem. There was a recall on the T-bird for the brake 
problem. The Ford dealer replaced the rotors and pads but the rotors warp 
after about 10K miles. Between this problem and the fit and finish problems on 
the T-Bird I'll never buy a Ford again.

Ford aimed for 75% US content when they designed the new Probe. In actual
practice it came out to 77% US content. If my '89 is any example the 23%
that is imported may be the engine and brakes, at least the '89 had

I hadn't heard of the Valentine-1 before. Car&Driver and other auto
magazines
recommend BEL detectors.  I was considering their latest - the 966STi -
which picks up Super Wideband Ka and Laser as well.  It also avoids 
radar detector detectors (although I really don't care about this since I
doubt I'll be driving in Virginia anytime soon - or have any other states
also made detectors iilegal?)

How does the Valentine-1 compare with the BEL products?

poram@ihlpb.att.com writes:
   On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.
   To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:
   1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
   anachronisms.
   2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices
   which are at variance with sacred Scripture.
   3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of
   subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.
   4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine
   Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and
   poetic and religious feeling.

First, to point out the obvious: While #4 would clearly be a highly
subjective issue, one would be hard pressed to point to another book
of the OT (or for that matter the NT) that doesn't, on some issues, in
some way, fail one or more of the first three of these tests.

Second, one factor the Deuterocanonicals share is the lateness of
their composition.  I don't recall the exact dating of all of the
books, but most --if not all-- were written after the latest of the
canonical books (i.e. Daniel).

Furthermore, while the Deuterocanonical may or may not have been
originally written in Greek, they are clearly deeply _Hellenistic_ in
nature.  Both of these features probably figured heavily in the
rejection of these books from the various canons.

These may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which to
judge the canonicity of these books, but, as these discussions have
shown, I think the one thing we can see is that there _are_ no purely
objective standards for determining canonicity.

On the other hand, remember the old adage that a verbal agreement isn't worth
the paper it's printed on.  Once you sign, you are going to have one hell of a
time proving fraud based on a comparison to what you thought you were going to
sign ...

PURPOSE OF THE NEWSGROUP: 
========================

    The following are the main purposes this group shall achieve:

    i)    To highlight the common beliefs of all major religions 
          and philosophical traditions as they relate to Ahmadiyya 
          Muslim Community.

    ii)   To discuss the doctrines, origin and teachings the Ahmad-
          iyya Muslim Community, a dynamic world-wide movement.

    iii)  To expound Islamic teachings and beliefs in the Holy 
          Quran and Islamic traditions from the Ahmadiyya Islamic
          perspective.

    iv)   To emphasize and discuss the similarities between Ahmadi 
          Muslims and followers of other religions of the world and 
          to explore how understanding and respect for each other's
          faith can be brought about to eliminate religious intol-
          erance and malice among people of all religious and phil-
          osophical traditions.
          
    v)    To look into the origin and teachings of all religions in
          general and of Islam and Ahmadiyya Muslim Movement in par-
          ticular, and to use the commonality of origin to foster
          better understanding among Ahmadi Muslims and other people
          and to promote an acceptance of universality of fundamental
          rights to the freedom of conscience.

    vi)   To point out current world problems and suggest solutions 
          to these problems, as offered by different religions and 
          systems of ethical philosophies.

    vii)  To investigate the implications of science on religion 
          with particular emphasis on the Ahmadi Muslim perspective,
          but with openness to dialogue with people of all religions
          and philosophical traditions with reasoned positions as to
          the relationship between religion and empirical science,
          logic, and scientific ethics. 
          
    viii) To exchange important news and views about the Ahmadiyya
          Muslim Community and of other religions.

    ix)   To add diversity to the existing religious newsgroups pre-  
          sent on Usenet in the interest of promoting a forum for
          decorous dialogue. 

    x)    To inquire why religious persecution is on the rise in the
          world and suggest solutions to remedy the ever deterior-
          ating situation in the world in general and in the Islamic
          world in particular. 

    xi)   To commemorate the contributions to humanity, society and
          world peace made by the founders and followers of all
          religions in general and by the International Ahmadiyya
          Muslim community in particular.


TYPE: 
====

The group will be MODERATED for orderly and free religious dialo-
gue. The moderation will NOT prevent disagreement, dissent, or 
controversy based on a difference of beliefs or doctrine; rather,
the moderators will seek mainly to discourage gratuitously deroga-
tory, abusive, or squalid language, and the introduction of issues
which are irrelevant based on the provisions of this charter. 

The moderators have been chosen through personal e-mail and through
a general consensus among the proponents by discussion in news.groups.
The following moderators have been proposed and agreed upon:

Moderator:     Nabeel A. Rana  <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu>
Co-Moderator:  Dr. Tahir Ijaz  <ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca>



A  BRIEF  DESCRIPTION  ABOUT  AHMADIYYA  ISLAM:
===============================================


        The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi-
sation, was found in 1889 in Qadian, India. The founder of this
movement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to 
be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures
of almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the 
fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ
(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.

        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and
extreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of 
divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-
ly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to 
openly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims
has been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United
Nations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International
and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns 
against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the
members of this movement, but so far to no avail.

        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-
inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the
world in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-
tural backgrounds.

        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards
developing a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims
have always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-
gious intolerance and fundamentalism.

        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-
tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics
in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by
volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's
internal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-
tion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of
professionals as well as world class individuals.

        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral

I recently got a document describing the JPEG FIF (JFIF) file
format. I was looking thru it, but I didn't get the idea how
to determine the size of a pic in pixel without decoding the
whole image.

How do you get the height and width of a JPEG in a JFIF?

How do you determine wether it is a color or a greyscale
picture?

I wrote a small tool (lsgif) for GIF that returns the
filesize, picture size and color resolution by analizing
the header chunks. The output looks like this:

  157605  bla.gif                                  640x 480  248C24

I use this lsgif to create index files of my archive and since
JPEG are getting more and more popular I would like to have a
similar tool for JFIF, with an output like this:

   57605  bla.jpg                                  640x 480     C24

Please respond by email, because I don't read this news

There are some tricks to installing ATM to windows... install them first
to dos, then run the ATM control panel to get them into windows.

The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard.  Truetype is a
failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about
keeping their formats proprietary.  Just about any service bureau or print
shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a TrueType document
to them for high resolution printing or ripping.

Although there are lots of pretty TT fonts floating around, they are really
for dot matrix or your own lazer printer.
However, you can convert your TT fonts with Fontmonger or some similar program
to ATM fonts for high end stuff.

If you are using dot matrix for all your printing, you may have wasted
your money!

Before we get into another discussion on the relative merits of a car alarm,
let's go on the assumption that one is desired.  The question then remains,
which one?  I've owned a Hornet, and was satisfied, but not enough to get
another for my new car.  The Alpine has been highly recommended, but what about
Clifford and VSE's Derringer 2?  Any others?  I want all of the standard stuff;

	So what is justifiable?  As you stated very explicitly from the new
	Catechism, the only justifiable case is when it is necessary to keep
	the peace.  Since that does not apply *at all* to this country, the
	logical conclusion (based on your own premises) is that one must be

Actually, severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are
possible, and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2
mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this.  There are non-surgical ways,
however, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their
ostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this.
The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of
sinus surgery, though.

About asthma, that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,
""Sinus Survival"", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many cases
of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage
(postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found
relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated -
not clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.

Before doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery,
as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.

Subject: REVIEW: 1989 Ford Taurus SHO
Organization: Purdue University

Review of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim
=============================================

Background:

    Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from driving
a 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have been
interested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing
the classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a
remarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.
As far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still
have another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.

    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was
already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as
having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.
However, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I
can get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the
car received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum
plugs and valve adjustment.

    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.
The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,
although the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small
scratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the
highway.

    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit
concerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To
my surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems
just as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)
Visibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of
the small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and
in front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit
more difficult, but other than that, I love the size.

    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up
for a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the
ride later in this review.


Engine:
    
    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very
interested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha ""Shogun"" engine.  I was not
disappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is
good.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although
I don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly
-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good
since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.
(More on this later.)

    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be
unremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit
higher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can
literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve
more valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and
you are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.
The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!

    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the
tach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,
you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than
adequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves
are used.


Transmission:

    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they
marvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter
into the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and
remember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the
car in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.

    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a
Ford recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the
one on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit
larger and more forgiving.

    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter
felt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect
it to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's
much the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it's
a clumsy shifter.

    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress
friends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for
the 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this
pretty amazing in a car like this.

    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest
shifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my
Toyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.
Someone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line
because of the incredibly clumsy shifter.

    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more
reasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works
smoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifter
upgrade would help at all.

    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears
smoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to
match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took
several days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems
were because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad
shifts in higher gears.)

    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter
refuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to 
get it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple
of months.

    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500
rpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the
engine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can
definitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,
as do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a ""SHO
sound"" and is the gearbox -- apparently called ""gear rollover"".
Replies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.


Exterior:

    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this
SHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are
virtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes
don't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did
differently to the SHO bodies.

    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching
color body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the
SHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at
stoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.
:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely
monochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with
""SHO"" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have
colored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.

    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel
almost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and
distinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)


Interior:

    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the
car.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are
covered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in
a black/grey/metallic scheme.  

    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo
and 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a
large compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest
that contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin
holders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding
cassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small
glove compartment.

    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted
to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a
sink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and
thoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before the
interior was upgraded!

    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need so
much space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)

    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From
what I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.
Mine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's has
cracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the
way.

    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal
hand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that
you press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used to
it, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.


Ride:

    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer than
any car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter
and is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with
less ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a
noisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels
wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I
listened for that before I bought the car.

    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from
Chicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone
from trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relatively
quiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out what
exactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window
that rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.

    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the
suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way
too rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would
advise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as with
the shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason
to complain.  Let me explain...

    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the
wheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer
making the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I
avoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.

    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.

    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.
My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the
wheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when
driving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so
useful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road
to the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much better
than the steering on my Celica ST.

    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?


Miscellaneous notes:

    GRIPES:

    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles
        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.

    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as
	it retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.
	Again, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)

    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension
	and torque steer, I've never complained about ride.

    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the
	side bolsters would close more tightly.  

    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I
	currently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500
	for four.

    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it
	to use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't
	really mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!
	Pretty ridiculous, though.

    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,
	this is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque
	down low.

    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It
	took me a couple of days before I could really shift
	smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)

    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that
	it is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. 
	Astute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make
	my SHO last -- I just bought a book titled ""Drive It Forever""
	for tips in this department.  :-)

    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once
	parked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch
	after I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off
	the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car 
	is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began 
	to wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of

    LIKES:

    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The
    	cupholders are great.

    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but
	it really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by
	pressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And
	you can never lock yourself out of the car.

    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't
	believe that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years 
	ahead of schedule.  :-)

    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to
	look into buying one.  I love this car so much that I
	wrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines
	and ended up with this.  

    If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have
	an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this 
	car.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this
	point in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you
	can't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)

    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums
	as on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice
	the horsepower.  



Other Odds and Ends:

    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.
Maybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I
haven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still
appear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always
quick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some
of the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)

    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as
well as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be 
posting this in the form of a FAQ soon.  

    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!
I don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but 
maybe someone out there does.

Not exactly correct, but nice try.  The Catholic doctrine of infallibility
refers to freedom from error in teaching of the universal Church in 
matters of faith or MORALS.  It is this teaching which is taken as 
doctrine.

THE SOURCE AND NT MEANING
OF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS
FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY

                                      James B. DeYoung

W. Petersen

     More recently Wright's understanding has itself been questioned from a
different direction.  In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguistic
confusion in using the English word ""homosexuals"" as the meaning of
arsenokoitai.[22]   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for
rendering it by ""homosexuals"" in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10.

     In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs into a
single assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of Bailey.  He finds
""homosexuals"" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic.  ""A
major disjunction"" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the
thought and terminolgy in Paul's time (187-88).

      What is this ""disjunction""?  He bases it on historical and linguistic
facts.  Accordingly, ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as
polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts. 
Virtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable. 
Christianity simply added the categories of ""natural"" and ""unnatural"" in
describing these actions.  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of
""homosexuals"" and ""heterosexuals,"" and assumed that, in the words of Dover
quoted approvingly by Petersen, ""everyone responds at different times to both
homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . ."" (188). [23]

      In contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term ""homosexual""
to desire and propensity.  K.M. Benkert, who in 1869 coined the German term
equivalent to ""homosexual,"" used it as referring to orientation, impluse or
affectional preference and having ""nothing to do with sexual acts"" (189).

     Petersen then proceeds to cite the ""Supplement to the Oxford English
Dictionary,""  which defines ""homosexual"" only as a propensity or desire with no
mention of acts.  Petersen's point is that by using ""homosexuals"" for
arsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history
""where no equivalent concept existed"" (189).  Consequently the translation is
inaccurate because it ""includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludes
heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includes
female homosexuals"" (19=89).  Prior to 1869 there was no ""cognitive structure,
either inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation of
humanity into 'homosexuals' and 'hetersosexuals' made sence"" (189).

     The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio
""homosexual"" is mistaken.  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one
mistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds?  The next
phases of this paper will critically examine Petersen's position.

                        THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING
                          ARSENOKOITAI BY ""HOMOSEXUALS""

Historical Grounds

     A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai
by ""homosexuals"" begins with the historical and cultural evidence.  Since
virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Paul's
usage, no historical settings earlier than his are available.  Yet much writing
reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary
with Paul.  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of
homosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar to
present-day concepts.  

     Peterson, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs claim that the homosexual
condition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot be
part of the definition of the term.  They assert this either because the term
is limited to acts of particular kind (Boswell, active male prostitutes; 
Scroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient
times (Bailey; Petersen).  The following discussion will show why neither of
these positions is legitimate.  Attention will be devoted to the latter postion
first with the former one being addressed below under ""Linguistic Grounds.""

     In regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not the
homosexual condition exist before 1869?  Is it only a modern phenomenon? Yet if
it is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always including
ancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it. 
Indeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-Christian and Christian, not only
knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms of
same-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sex
orientation or condition.  Petersen admits (190 n. 10) that Plato in
""Symposium"" (189d-192d) may be a ""sole possible exception"" to ancient
ingnorance of this condition.  He discounts this, however, believing that even
here ""acts appear to be the deciding factor.""  However, this is a very
significant exception, hardly worthy of being called ""an exception,"" because of
the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition.

     THe ""Symposium"" of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for
knowledge about the homosexual condition. [24]   Plato posits a third sex
comprised of a maile-female (androgynon (""man-woman""). Hence ""original nature""
palai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings.  Zeus sliced these
human beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the
gods.  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of the
opposite sex or one of the same sex.  Plato then quotes Aristophances:

    Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like
    a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two;  and each is ever
    searching for the tally that will fit him.  All the men who are sections
    of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are 
    woman-courters;  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex,
    whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses.
    All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men:
    they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions.
    Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as 
    their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by
    making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be
    clasped in men's embrasces;  these are the finest boys and striplings,
    for they have the most manly nature.  Some say they are shameless
    creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness
    but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome
    their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity
    these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come
    to man's estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in
    wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of
    custom;  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.
    A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the 
    willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind.  Well, when
    one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort- 
    happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously 
    thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be 
    induced to leave each other's side for a single moment.  These are
    they who continue together throughout life, though they could not
    even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25]

Should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as
long as they live, or even in Hades, Aristophanes says that each ""would
unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all
the time:  (192e).

     Several observations about this text are in order.  Lesbianism is
contemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e).  ""Natural interest"" (ton
noun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination. 
The words, ""born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man: 
(paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims ""to
be born this,"" i.e., as homosexual.  The idea of mutuallity (""the two of them
are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love,"" 192b) is
present.  Aristophanes even speaks of ""mutual love ingrained in mankind
reassembling our early estate"" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai
tes archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). The concept of permanency (""These are
they who continue together throughout life,"" 102c) is also present.  Further
mention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, ""gay pride,"" pederasty,
homophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works is
recognizable.

    Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from
actions.  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is
crucial;  money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b). 
They mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e).  There are tow
kinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its ""desire"" and ""passion""
(186b-d).  The speakers discuss the principles or ""matters"" of love (187c), the
desires of love (192c) and being ""males by nature"" (193c).  Noteworthy is the
speech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is
related to love and its objects (200a-201c).  Desire is felt for ""what is not
provided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack.""  This is
the object of desire and love.  Socrates clearly distinguishes between ""what
sort of being is love"" and the ""works"" of love (201e).  This ancient
philosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition of
being or nature.  His wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26]

     In summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and
homosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato.  Petersen is in error
when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, not
inclination or orientation.  Widespread evidence to the contray supports the
latter. [27]

     Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where
homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction.  In
Rom 1:21-28 such phrases as ""reasoning,"" ""heart,"" ""becoming foolish,"" ""desires
of the heart."" and ""reprobate mind"" prove Paul's concern for disposition and
inclination along with the ""doing"" or ""working"" of evil (also see vv. 29-32). 
Even the catologues of vices are introdiced (I Tim 1:8-10) or concluded (I Cor
6:9-11) by words describing what people ""are"" or ""were,"" not what they ""do."" 
Habits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf. Matt.
23:28).  The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives rise
to the other (cf. Mt 5:27).

     Petersen errs regarding other particulars too.  Transvestism apparently
was accepted by the ancients.   It was practiced among Canaaniteds, Syrian,
people of Asia Minor, as well as Greeks, according to S.R. Driver. [28]  Only a
few moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it.  For example,
Seneca (Moral Epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an
adult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman.  Philo also goes to
some length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women
(The Special Laws III, 37-41;  see also his On the Virtues, 20-21, where he
justifies prohibition of cross-dressing).  Even the OT forbade the interchange
of clothing between the sexes  (Deut 22:5).

     Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the
""new labels"" of ""natural"" and ""unnatural"" for sexual behavior.  These did not
begin with Paul (Rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient Greece and even
non-Christian contemporaries used them.  Plato, the TEST.NAPH., Philo, Josephu,
Plutarch, and others used these words or related concepts. [29]

23 K.J. Dover, Greek Homosexuality (Cambridge, Harvard Univ, 1978) 1 n. 1.
24    We are conscious of the fact that Plato's writings may not reflect
Athenian society, or that the speakers in ""Symposium"" may not reflect Plato's
view.  However, it is assumed that they do, and with this agrees Dover
(Homosexuality 12) and other evidence cited below 
25 The translation is that of W.R.M. Lamb, Plato:  Symposioum LCL (Cambridge:
Harvard Univ, 1967) 141-143.  Note the reference to ""adulteress.""  If there is
a homosexual condition derived from birth or the genes, logically there must
also be an adulterous conditon derived from birth.
26 Elsewhere in the Symposium we are told that it is the heavenly love to love
the male and young men (181c) but this must not be love for boys too young; 
the latter should be outlawed (181d-e).  Such love of youths is to be permanent
(181d), lifelong and abiding (184a).  Where homosexual love is considered a
disgrace, such an attitude is due to encroachments of the rulers and to the
cowardice of the ruled (182d -an early charge of ""homophobia""?).  In Athens it
was ""more honorable to love openly than in secret"" (182d -an ancient expression
of ""coming out of the closet"").  Mutality was present (""this compels lover and
beloved alike to feel a zealous concern for their own virtue,"" 184b).
    For Petersen to label the Symposium a ""possible"" exception to his position
is inadequate and misrepresentative.  It is a significant witness to Greek
society hundreds of years before the time of Christ.
27 Dover (Homosexuality 12, 60-68) finds homosexual desire and orientation in
Plato's works (Symposioum and Phaedrus) and elsewhere.  Philo writes of those
who ""habituate themselves"" to the practive of homosexual acts (The Special Laws
3.37-42; cf. De Vita Contemplativa 59-63).  Josephus says that homosexuality
had become a fixed habit for some (Against Apion 2.273-75)  Clement of
Alexandria on Matt. 19:12 writes the ""some men, from birth, fhave a natural
aversion to a woman; and indeed those who are naturally so consitited do well
not to marry"" (Miscellanies 3:1)  It is addressed in Novella 141 of Justinian's
Codex of laws (it referes to those ""who have been consumed by this disease"" as
in need of renouncing ""there plague,"" as well as acts).  Pseudo Lucian (Erostes
48) and Achilles Tatius (Leucippe and Clitophon II.38) speak of it.  Finally
Thucydides 2.45.2 has: ""Great is you glory if you fall not below the standard
which nature has set for your sex.""
     Boswell (Christianity 81-87) cites poets (Juvenal, Ovid), witers
(Martial), statesmen (Cicero), and others who describe permanent, mutual
homosexual relationships, even marriages.  Even emperors could be either
gay-married (Nero) or exlusively gay (Hadrian), Boswell says.  Scroggs
(Homosexuality 28, 32-34) admits that both inversion and perversion must have
existed in the past.  He discusses possible references to adult mutual
homosexual and lesbian relationships, but dismisses them (130-44).
28  See specifics in S.R. Driver A critical and Exegetical Commentary on
Deuteronomy (Edinburgh:1895) 250.  He observes that the prohibition of
cross-dressing in Deut. 22:5 is not a ""mere rule of conventional propriety."" 
See also Dover, Homosexuality  73-76, 144.
29  Plato in his last work, in which he seeks to show how to have a virtuous
citizen, condemned pederasty and marriage between men as ""against nature"" (para
phosin)(Laws 636a-b;  636c;  836a-c; 838; 841d-e).  According to TEST.NAPH
3:4-5 the sodomites changed the ""order of nature.""  THe Jewish writers, Philo
(On Abraham 135-137) and Josephus (Ant. 1.322; 3.261, 275; Ag. Ap. 2.199;
2.273, 275) label sexual deviation as ""against nature.""  Finally,, first
century moralist such as Plutarch (Dianlogue on Love 751c-e; 752b-c) spoke of
homosexuality as ""against nature.""  Christians clearly did not invent the
labels ""natural"" and ""unnatural"".  See J.B. De Young, ""The Meaning of 'Nature'
in Romans 1 and Its Implications for Biblical Prosecriptions of Homosexual
Behavior"" JETS 31/4 (Dec 1988):429-41.

If you don't agree with Joseph's accurate statement of the Catholic dogma
of Mary's perpetual sinlessness, then how do you interpret Luke 1:28,

	And when the angel had come to her, he said, ""Hail, full of 
	grace, the Lord is with thee.  Blessed art thou among women.""

and Luke 1:48? 

	...for, behold, henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

I suppose that these verses might be interpreted to mean that Mary was
possessed of some limited quantity or quality of grace, just as some of 
us are, but it seems to me that ""full of grace"" means just what it says:   
filled to the brim, incapable of containing more.  The only other people we 
know of who have an abundance of grace are those souls existing in heaven now 
(another Catholic dogma, based on the communion of saints, as I explained in 
an earlier post).  Full of grace to me means sinless, and anyone who has 
ever sinned in his life cannot be without sin in the same sense as Mary  
was sinless.  

As a Catholic, I too find certain of the dogmas tough to embrace.  But
that's where the Catholic faith and prayer come into play.  I pray God
to strengthen my will to accept the faith given the bride of Christ,
which in turn usually strengthens my community faith in His Church.  And,
as you probably know, faith in Christ's Church is tantamount to faith in
Christ inasmuch as the Church is Christ's Mystical Body.  A Catholic by
nature must have two aspects to his faith in Christ: (1) a personal faith in 
Christ as his own personal redeemer and (2) a community faith in the Church 
as the body of Christ.

[You might want to check the Greek.  ""full of grace"" translates a
single word that simply means ""favored"", or perhaps more literally,
""graced"".  The ""full"" is a vestige of the specific translation you're
using.  --clh]

We here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations.  I was also
shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by
about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only
1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  What
is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due
mainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is
more like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at
different x/y values, the ""ridges"" are out of phase, resulting in the
stitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon
right on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see
a smeared effect where they overlap.
  Example:
  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)
      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)

Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when
rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces
with isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as
you say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the
system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the
application must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.
Bravo!

This question came up in Sci. Med. Nutrition and I'm posting my answer 
here.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human 
nutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do 
when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community.
I think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the 
mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(and 
their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that 
most physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by 
diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shooting 
your flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is 
justified.

> Michael, I've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got 
side-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most 
physicians don't recognize it as a specific ""disease"" entity.  Here is 
everything that you would ever want to know about PMS.

Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups:

	PMT-A(Anxiety)		PMT-D(depression)
	anxiety			depression
	irritability		forgetfulness
	insomnia		confusion
	depression		lethargy

	PMT-C(Craving)		PMT-H(Hyperhydration)
	craving for sweets	weight gain
	increased appetite	breast congestion and tenderness
	sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness
	 1. headache		edema of the face and extremities
	 2. palpitations
	 3. fatigue or fainting
 
PMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low 
progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle.

PMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple 
carbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is 
increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose 
challenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are 
a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia 
is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of 
hypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia.
	A. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990).
Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium 
supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of 
the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources 
of alpha linoleic acid.

PMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal 
phase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead 
toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal 
phase). ""Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human 
endometrial cystol"" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972).

PMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated 
serum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E 
for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H

This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form:

	A. ""Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for 
	    a nutritional approach"". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine. 
	    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986.

	B. ""Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension 
	    syndromes"", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983).

	C. ""Premenstrual tension"", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980)

Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can 
find a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one 
that will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work, 
supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really 
has been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida 
blooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental 
controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to 
see done).

Here are a few of these studies:

	CARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, ""Effect of a low-fat, 
	high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy"" Lancet 
	2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy 
	of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive 
	specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories 
	and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary 
	advise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant 
	reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in 
	the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as 
	physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, 
	tenderness and nodularity.

	VITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, ""The use of Vitamin A in 
	premenstrual tension"" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960).  
	218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU 
	vitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored 
	and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of 
	toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the 
	study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool 
	size(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this 
	normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose 
	vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% 
	getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.
  	10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS 
	symptoms.

	Experimental Controlled Study, ""Premenstrual tension treated with 
	vitamin A"" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts 
	received 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their 
	cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.
  	After 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in 
	PMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of 
	toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year 
	after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms 
	did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the 
	vitamin A supplementation was stopped.

Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.  
These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal 
store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins 
given for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best 
single effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid 
(estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full 
of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent 
the symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying 
to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin 
A toxicity.

	VITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, ""Pyridoxine
	(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover 
	trial""J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 
	with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.
  	After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 
	3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of 
	PMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS 
	were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation.

	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""The efects of vitamin B6 
	supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms"" Obstet. Gynecol 
	70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received 
	150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence 
	showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related 
	to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as 
	behavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)
  	Anxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 
	supplementation.

Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control 
pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.  
Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per 
day.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. 
Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in 
Clin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be 
considered the ""first-line"" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the 
patient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin 
B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each 
day. 


	VITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Efficacy of alpha-
	tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome"" J. Reprod. 
	Med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 
	cycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a 
	significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast 
	tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant
 	reduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% 
	had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo 
	group.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant
	decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group.

	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""The effect of alpha-tocopherol on 
	premenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study"" J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 
	2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly 
	received vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After 
	2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly 
	improved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly 
	improve PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H
	(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve 
	PMT-H symptoms).
	
	MAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Magnesium prophylaxis 
	of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium"" Headache 
	31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg 
	daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a 
	placebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and 
	continued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index 
	was significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment 
	was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual 
	Distress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in  
	lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower 
	in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer 
	from PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised 
	into the normal range.

	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Oral Magnesium successfully 
	relieves premenstrual mood changes"" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). 
	32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 
	360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the 
	onset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received 
	magnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster 
	pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the 
	magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were 
	switched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on 
	the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by 
	magnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium 
	supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes 
	that occur during PMS.

There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the 
medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder 
that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But 
since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. 
to be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are 
also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on 
multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the 
best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out 
that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize 
nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, 
pellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor 
being trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS 
is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional 
disorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses.

Here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral 
supplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS.

	Experimental Study, ""Effect of a nutritional programme on 
	premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis"", Complement. Med. 
	Res.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and 
	supplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E, 
	magnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to 
	take the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate 
	diet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an 
	improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that 
	they no longer suffered from PMS. 


	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Role of Nutrition in managing 
	premenstrual tension syndromes"", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987).  
	A low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite 
	supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet 
	change and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the 
	vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased 
	estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel 
	phase of their cycle.

	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Clinical and biochemical effects 
	of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome"", J. 
	Reprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 
	tablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a 
	significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another
 	group of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this 
	second group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on 
	PMS symptoms was observed.

The basic definition that I use is:
	The belief that Jesus was God incarnate.
	The belief that Jesus was crucified and raised from the dead

	The acceptance of Jesus as personal Lord and Savior.

This would include most Christian denominations, but exclude the Unitarians.

          There is a small problem a friend of mine is experiencing and I 
would appreciate any help at all with it.

My friend has been diagnosed as having a severe case of depression requiring 
antidepressants for a cure. The main problem is the side effects of these. 
So far she has been prescribed Prozac, Aurorix, and tryptanol all with 
different but unbearable side effects.

The Prozac gave very bad anxiety/jitters and insomina, it was impossible to 
sit still for more than a minute or so.

The Aurorix whilst having a calming effect, all feelings were lost and the 
body co-ordination was similar to a drunken person. Her brain was clouded 
over.

The tryptanol gave tremors in the legs and panic attacks along with unco- 
ordination occurred. She did not know what she was doing as her brain was 
""closed down"".

Has anyone had similar problems and/or have any suggestions as to the next 
step?

Thankyou in advance.

Gordon Taylor

Its bogus.  See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).

You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the
Classic Example, but there are probably others.

Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By
looking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises
you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.

The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:

1: How does it work?

2: What evidence is there?

The answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to
evaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book on
reflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the
organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are
supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or
energy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures.
(Always beware the words ""channel"" and ""energy"" in any spiel put out
by an alternative practitioner.)

The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is
anecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in
mainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of
rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done
and papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.

The word ""licensed"" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by
whom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and
requires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong
plants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove
and Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license
extends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be
told that it means ""(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist"".

BTW, the usual term is ""herbalist"".  Why use a different word?

I have proposed the forming of a consortium/task force for the
promotion of NAPLPS/JPEG, FIF to openly discuss ways, method,
procedures,algorythms, applications, implementation, extensions of
NAPLPS/JPEG standards.  These standards should facilitate the creation
of REAL_TIME Online applications that make use of Voice, Video,
Telecommuting, HiRes graphics, Conferencing, Distant Learning, Online
order entry, Fax,in addition these dicussion would assist all to
better understand how SGML, CALS, ODA, MIME, OODBMS, JPEG, MPEG,
FRACTALS, SQL, CDrom, cdromXA, Kodak PhotoCD, TCL, V.FAST, and
EIA/TIA562, can best be incorporated and implemented to develop
TELEMATIC/Multimedia applications.

We want to be able to support DOS, UNIX, MAC, WINDOWS, NT, OS/2
platforms.  It is our hope that individuals, developers, corporations,
Universities, R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.

This would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter. Already
many corporations have decided to support OTG (Open TELEMATIC Group) so
do not delay joining if you are a developer

An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon
be be composed to start promulgating what is known on the subject.  If
you would like to be added to the maillist send email or mail to the
address below.

This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPS/JPEG
newsletter as well as a hardcopy version.  We urge all who wants to
see CMCs HiRes based applications & the NAPLPS/JPEG G R O W, decide to
join and mutually benefit from this NOT-FOR_PROFIT endeavor.

NOTE: Telematic has been defined by Mr. James Martin as the marriage
      of Voice, Video, Hi-res Graphics, Fax, IVR, Music over telephone
      lines/LAN.

I can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for 
homosexuality.  Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of 
bestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe.  Let me ask 
this gently:  why are you so judgemental of other people's sexual preferences?  
What happened to ""No doubt I am free to do anything""?  I think you have a 
serious double standard here.  When you describe a comparison between 
homosexuality and bestiality as ""slimey"" and ""sleazy"", you are making an 
implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting, 
unnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about 
homosexuality.  Not all people share your view.  You claim not to know any 
sincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  They even 
have their own newsgroup:  alt.sex.bestiality.  Are you going to accuse them 
all of being mere ""jokers""?

I notice you deleted the main point of my comment:  the fact that the only 
Biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical 
prohibitions against homosexuality.  While there are some New Testament 
passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none 
that condemn bestiality.  One of your main points seems to be that Christian 
homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any ""clear"" New Testament 
statements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian 
zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament 
makes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all?

I am quite serious here.  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically 
acceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply 
the same standards to everyone else's declared sexual preferences as well.  If 
the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual 
preferences as well, I'm going to apply them and see what comes up.  I'm not 
trying to ""torpedo a serious issue"" by using what you label ""a ridiculous 
joke"".  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines 
for Christian sexuality, and I don't think such a question is ""irrelevant"" in a 
group called ""soc.religion.christian"".  The Bible discusses homosexuality and 
bestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good 
precedent for doing the same.

I don't know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a 
side issue for me.  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging 
people to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine 
whether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling.  I can read in the New 
Testament that ""God has joined together"" heterosexual couples, and that the 
marriage bed is undefiled.  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual 
intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under 
the Law.  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards 
of defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the 
sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days.  I don't think it's 
right to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to 
Christians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn't.  
That was pretty much what you said earlier, right?  You used different 
examples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong 
to apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians.

It was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction.  I personally don't 
get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual 
orientation; I'm afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar 
attitude.  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with 
child abuse.  I have merely noted that, for all the lack of ""clear"" NT 
condemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation 
(or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on 
alt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation.

This is an excellent question, and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere 
rhetorical question, but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the 
answer.  I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you 
yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia.  Why do you find 
bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in 
connection with other alternative sexual orientations?  Why do you not apply 
all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply 
them to homosexuals?

Is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at 
the thought?  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of 
homosexual intercourse.  Is it because you regard the practice as socially 
unacceptable?  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.  
Do you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual 
morality?  Many people feel that homosexuality does.  Do you feel the Bible 
condemns it?  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality 
than it does to condemn bestiality.  Why then do you think comparing bestiality 
with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality?  If you can honestly answer 
this question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many 
people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality.

Also please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*.  I am merely 
pointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that 
the Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage.  When I say I think 
adultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love 
my neighbor?  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and 
unmentionable, are you disobeying ""repeated orders not to judge or condemn 
others""?  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you 
and judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same 
offense?  Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible 
brands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God?

I'm not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs.  If you mean that Jesus 
is the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I 
agree.  If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior.  Our 
salvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us, 
and we can now do whatever we want.  Nor does Christ's grace mean that those 
who refer to sin as ""sin"" are being judgemental or intolerant.  I am speaking 
in general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality.  If the Bible 
calls something ""sin"", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it 
sin too.

As applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on 
Christian sexuality is the Bible.  If you make a list of everything the Bible 
says on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every 
verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and ""unclear"" at best.  
The most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some 
dispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as 
condemning homosexual intercourse.  That is, from a gay perspective, the most 
positive thing you can say about the Bible's treatment of homosexuality is that 
some verses fail to clearly condemn it.  That's it.  Jesus declared all foods 
clean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to 
keep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from 
being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian 
practice.  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination 
that defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you 
have some verses which are at best ""not clear"" but which some people believe 
*are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that's the sum 
total of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse.

I can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything 
simple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and 
those-who-oppose-me-are-wicked.  However, I do not think the Bible makes your 
case as definitively as you would like it to.  In fact, I don't believe it says 
anything positive about your case at all.  Yes, I know the verses about loving 
one another, and not judging one another, but that's not really the issue, is 
it?  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for 
Christians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you.  
Therefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.  
Even if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still 
left with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about 
homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who 
are under the law and those who are not.

- Mark


[Actually I don't think the reaction to the comparision with
bestiality is based on bestialophobia.  I think what he regards as
slimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality and
bestiality.  Most people who accept homosexuality take a radical
approach to the Law.  They regard all of Lev as not binding on
Christians.  The argument is that there's no way in the text to
separate bestiality, homosexuality, and wearing mixed fabrics.  This
does not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct, nor
does it mean that they accept bestiality.  It simply means that their
sexual ethics does not come from the Law, and particularly not from
Lev.  --clh]

not sure about there in CA, but here in US, the manuals are quite often the
standard equipment.  Of course, FINDING a car with one might be hard, but
if you read the sticker on the window, there is usally an additional 2k or
so tacked on for that lousy  tranny.  So you actually ARE paying more, just
that it's sometimes hard to find one that is equipped ""standard"".  (this
applies to MOST cars, but not to the luxoyachts..eg caddilac, licolns, etc..)

Though there is a command in the law not to heed to one who prophecies 
falsely, it is still possible for the one who has prophecied falsely
to prophecy truely again.  Take, for example the story in Kings about the
man of God from Judah who came to israel and prophecied against a king.
The Lord had commanded him to not eat or drink till he returned home.
Another prophet wanted this man of God to stay in his house, so he
prophecied falsely that the Lord wanted the man of God to stay in his 
house.  While they ate and drank in his house, the Lord gave the prophet
who lied a word that the man of God would die from breaking the word of
the Lord.  It came to pass.

I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that
will do compositing of a series of pictures?

What I mean by ""compositing"" is, say I have a live video clip
(digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated
bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of
pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want
the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this
with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do
manual compositing also.  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at
a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway.  But being able to
composite a series of frames would be even better.

I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform
this.  Help, please!

I've sent Gordon R. my posts on protein, vitamin C and vitamin A prior to 
posting on internet as a professional courtesy.  Somehow I've managed to 
delete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send 
it back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it.
Since digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all 
day for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has 
them).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and 
Morgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to 
point out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical 
community.

Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long 
time.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've 
already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.
Now I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in 
the U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).

When vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as 
the anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have 
decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C
(which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is 
also getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).
The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if 
vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in 
both cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).

Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and 
beta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene 
is the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-
carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present
(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other 
tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human 
adult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We 
are born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about 
30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they 
were born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that 
of retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is 
not going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient 
reserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.

The U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of 
vitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet 
surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A
(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National 
Research Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the 
RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to 
7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was 
killed.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main 
reason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient 
reserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to 
move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move 
towards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have 
some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely 
important during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that 
battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 
1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the 
dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 
1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill 
the reserves).

We know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a 
normal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient 
reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.
But for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how 
much somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has 
overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol 
level(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your 
liver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal 
range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is 
diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation 
of Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level 
of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to 
vitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative 
approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in 
this post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty 
of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, 
redness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).

I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they 
had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear 
signs that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient 
needs the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you 
will always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for 
PMS studies).

Beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will 
never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to 
retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the 
liver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But 
taking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to 
fill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% 
that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One 
other problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not 
convert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the 
enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of 
retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will 
cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.

Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body 
uses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be 
nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde
(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the 
retinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses 
retinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells 
and the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes, 
one of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the 
title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play 
a role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role 
is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake 
of vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But 
retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once 
it's formed, it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC 
group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's.

Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are 
helping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and 
they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do 
themselves more harm than good.

Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.
In the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus 
production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from 
entering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the ""first 
line"" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown 
to act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which 
stimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration 
and cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters 
are not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not 
normally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process.
This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials 
in progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.

Chronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that 
vitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who 
walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be 
worked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already 
has on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my 
course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic 
medical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.

Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night 
vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The 
serum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver 
reserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have 
trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled 
out).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels 
were measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 
20ug/dl.

As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of 
the U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably 
see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low 
serum retinol levels.

What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts
from their book:

Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for 
growth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for 
reproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie 
malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and 
metabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, 
which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not 
in reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A 
status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal 
range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are 
indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater 
than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation 
tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to 
perform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to 
vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The 
bronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal 
tract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than 
7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts 
over 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, 
erythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois
(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.  

They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A 
deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol 
level is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in 
adults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule 
out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical 
lab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give 
them the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity 
should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the 
patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.

Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A.
Recall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A.
I don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to 
fill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the 
serum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the 
vitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a 
demonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will 
provide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status 
are good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more 
agressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But 
vitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could 
become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human 
fetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 
18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on 
the human fetus.

Could just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes 
but the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use 
retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it 
full.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to 
prescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup 
jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A 
supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I 
think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market 
but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general 
public about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.

Adobe Streamline has been out four a couple of years. It does a much better
job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration
programs. Of course, a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more
accurate trace. The problem that I've run into though, is that when it

If I trace something manually, I use many less es points. The problem
with this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down, especially

The burden of proof rests upon those who claim the existence

by any available data.  Hopefully, as a scientist, you would

Gee, I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about
myself, my friends, and my family, but in the practice of
medicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for
basing therapy than ""Aunt Susie's brother-in-law ..."".

Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis,
but rarely proves anything in a positive sense.  And unlike
mathematics, boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical
issues, and so evidence of 'exceptions' does not usually
disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease.

This is something I've always found a little curious. I've never quite understood
the trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,
at the same time, he is God's son ""For God so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten son"". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could
he really be God's son? If the Holy Ghost ""planted the seed"" in Mary, so to speak,
then it seems that Jesus' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the
human father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father's 
qualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try
and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that
case, Jesus and God aren't the same. On the other hand, if their relationship
isn't the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God
incarnate, then he's not really God's son and he never was. He's just God
manifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I'm seeing it. Can someone
who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? 

Getting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid
to redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would
rise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing
how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body
may have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical
pain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.
The fact that Jesus was God's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have much
meaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only
one was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very
offensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my
sincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.
But, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.
 
[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.
First, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this
group, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You
seem to be suggesting the Jesus is God's son in a physical sense,
with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that
terrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin
Birth says that Jesus' birth is God's responsibility.  But it doesn't
imply that God's sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means
the only) speculation is that God used Joseph's genetic material.

Second, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a
Trinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is
a part of God.  The Son didn't come into existence with Jesus' birth.
Jesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn't
specifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it's the Son
who was incarnated.

I have been having problems with a slightly different clutch problem on
my 90 Prelude. See rec.autos.tech for more detail. My problem is a false
engagement point below the actual one. It also seems affected by weather -
it is most noticeable (and annoying) on damp or cold days. My dealer says
he can't reproduce the problem - I think I'll just sell the car.

   I sure don't know what and how they measure in regards to diesel 
 motors in cars, trucks, and busses, but I think they are probably
 measuring the wrong pollutants, or at the wrong time, or both.

   I certainly find it offensive to drive behind a diesel bus or
 diesel truck and some diesel cars.  They stink!  And it's always
 roll-up-the-windows panic time when one comes by or ducks in front
 of me when I am driving with my family.

   I don't think the combustion mixture is kept under very good
 control in diesel engines, and that's why they stink.  So the 
 invisible, unsmellable pollutants are reduced in diesels.  Yeah,
 well so what!?  Someone forgot about the visible, stinky kind, and,
 as far as I am concerned, those kind are just as bad.

    I am all for de-stinking the diesel vehicles.  It'll keep the
 traffic signs cleaner, too.

One possible reason is that file' is made with sassafras leaves, while root
beer was made with sassafras bark or root bark.  The leaves contain either
no
or less saffrole than the bark.

There is also some sort of treatment which putatively removes saffrole from
sassafras products.  I have some concentrated sassafras tea extract which
is
claimed to have the saffrole removed.

Well, the last time that I went to the store to buy sassafras bark to make 
root beer, there was a sign saying that it wasn't sold for human
consumption.
Also, when I asked the person if they had wild cherry bark and wintergreen
bark,
she made a point of telling me that I couldn't buy sassafras for human 
consumption.

I find the fact that some people reckless enough to step into an automobile

    But no one (or at least, not many people) are trying to pass off God
as a scientific fact.  Not so with Kirlian photography.  I'll admit that

Having driven both, and having owned an SC300 for 14 months now, all I can
say is ""it depends"".  They're both great cars.  In fact, my wife and I
are saving our pennies so we can get her the 300ZX convertible in a year.
The 300ZX handles like a dream, while the SC300 rides like a dream.
Fit and finish on both are excellent, but the Lexus gets the nod in
customer satisfaction.  They're both very attractive, and hideously
expensive.  The resale value of the SC is better than the ZX.  The
300ZX isn't available with traction control, which makes it a handful
on slippery surfaces.

No wonder he became confused!  With so many drugs, it is almost impossible
to know which one is causing the problem.  And because some drugs 
potentiate the effect of each other, they can make the side effects
all the worse, and even dangerous.  (kinda like mixing alcohol and 
antihistamines!)

>...he was disoriened [the doctors thougt ] they should put him on something
>else as well!

Unfortunately, doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of
the drugs a patient is receiving.  If one drug they are taking causes
the patient's blood pressure to go up, many times an antihypertensive
is prescribed instead of re-evaluating the need for the original drug.
This is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs
at home!!!!

I fully agree.  In addition, she proably should be examined by another
doctor who can re-evaluate the need for the medications she is taking.
I can't remember the guidelines I either saw in a text or heard during
a lecture, but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have
the need for the drug re-evaluated regularly.  If her current physician
is unwilling to do this, find one who will.  Either check the phone 
book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology, 
or contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society.
By finding a geriatric specialist, he (she) will more likely be in tune
with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help.

""Authoritative"" is not a quality of the writing itself- it is a statement

: 2. Is it prophetic?

How is ""prophecy"" to be defined? If it is ""speaking forth"" of God's message,
much of the apocrypha must surely qualify.

: 3. Is it authentic?

Again, by what standard?  Is ""authenticity"" a function of the authors? the
historical accuracy? 

: 4. Is it dynamic?

What is this supposed to mean?  Many of the apocryphal books are highly
""dynamic"" -thought provoking, faithful, even exciting.

: 5. Is it received, collected, read and used?

By whom?  Of course the apocryphal books were received (by some),
collected (or else we would not have them), read and used (and they still are,
in the Catholic and Orthodox churches).

: On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.

This is demonstrably false.

: To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:
: 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
: anachronisms.

So do other books of the Bible.

: 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices
: which are at variance with sacred Scripture.

""False"" by whose interpretation?  Those churches that accept them find no
contradiction with the rest of scripture.  

: 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of
: subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.

This is a purely subjective evaluation.  The apocryphal books demonstrate
the same categories and forms of writing found in the other scriptures.
(In fact, one could argue that the apocryphal ""Additions to the Book of
Esther"" act rather to bring the ""unscripturelike"" book of Esther more into
line with other books.)

: 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine
: Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and
: poetic and religious feeling.

Have you ever read the Wisdom of Ben Sira or the Wisdom of Solomon?  They
exhibit every bit as much ""poetic and religious feeling"" as Psalms or
Proverbs.

[deletions]

: How do you then view the words: ""I warn everyone who  hears the
: words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to
: them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.
: And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will
: take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the
: holy city"" (Rev 22.18-9)
: Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.

These words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone,
not to the whole body of scripture.  Revelation itself was accepted very
late into the canon.  The church simply did not see it as having a primary
role of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture.

: It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude. He had no
: argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John
: 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus 
: that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the 
: OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51
: taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say
: Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture.

Jesus does not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day,
the canon had not been established as a closed collection.  The books
of the apocrypha were part of the Septuagint (which was the Bible of
the early church).  The Hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c.e.
The Torah (Pentateuch/ ""Law"") was established in Jesus' day, as were
the Prophets (with the _exclusion_ of Daniel).  The Writings, however,
were still in flux.  Jesus does not refer to the Writings, only to the
Psalms, which were part of them.  The books of the apocrypha were all
part of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated.

To argue that Jesus is referring to the Jewish canonical order in Luke 11:51
is weak at best; he is not quoting scripture, but telling a chronological
story.  And, as mentioned above, the Hebrew canon (especially in the
present order) did not exist as such in Jesus' day.

For your first set of questions (regarding the energy and will of Christ)
I quote to you the relevant part of the Statement signed by both Eastern
(Chalcedonian) and Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) Orthodox scholars a few
years ago (Both families = both Orthodox churches) :

1. Both  families  agreed in  condemning  the Eutychian heresy. Both  families
confess that the Logos, the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity, only begotten
of the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him, was incarnate and
was born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect
man with soul, body and mind  ($  \nu o  \upsilon \zeta $); He  was crucified,
died, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to the
Heavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of all
creation. At  Pentecost, by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested the
Church as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His
glory, according to the Scriptures.

2. Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of
Theodoret of  Cyrus. They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that
Christ is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us, by  nature God and
by nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by nature
God,  became by  nature   man, by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time.

3. Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite by
uniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which
He has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit, created human nature,
which He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own, with its natural will
and energy.

4. Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
are united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change,
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
without  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
thought alone.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

5. Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasis
of the Logos Incarnate.

[...]

I guess that adresses your question adequately.

As for your second set of questions, I am afraid they are irrelevant to the
discussion (at least from my point of view) of Monophysitism. I do not see
how they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start an
endless Orthodox-RC debate which I do not plan to engage into). As a brief
answer to your questions, the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church 
regarding the Roman pontiff, his jurisdiction, his infalability, etc.
is exactly the same as all the other Orthodox churches.

Peace,

I can see XV-3.00 agree with my view in cases you don't -- even I say
my personal opinion (as above), it doesn't mean that it is not most
obvious thing.
Please, if you use my previous writings as contradicting argument,
please do read them -- you have not saw them at all; you just
refered to text from which I wrote 'something' -- and you make
hard decisions from that, without reading what exactly I have written.

It is really hard read when one writes a reply line by line method
and don't understand include previously written material with the new
sentences to give them meaning. You seem to be one such.

You also start replying to my articles, even you don't understand what
is going on; you ask me repeatedly to decsribe my views what were
wrong with XV 2.21 even I posted them within the article you did reply
to. Believe me, it is not nice to get flamed specially when I know
that you have not read my article carefully in the first place.

XV-3.00 and JPEG FAQ and users I have written to agree me with the
places you didn't; I'm sure you just didn't undertand what about I
wrote. We can blame my writing skills (in English?) for that, or?

Or you could replace the stock shifter with a Hurst short-throw
shifter (available from Ford Motorsport), or any number of other
after-market products to boost the performance of a Mustang or
Camaro. Can you do _that_ with a '93 RX-7, or, verily, with _any_
MR-2? With the Detroit aftermarket, you can build a Mustang or
Camaro which is superior to either car you mention for less than
the sticker price of either.

>Or the Torsen differential of the RX7 compared to the Differential of

Well, gee. It works, and it doesn't break. It transmits power to
the drive wheels, and it's essentially zero maintenance--and there's
an aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rear-ends, too.

>And bythe way 5.0 and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks ...
>Hello , this is the 90 's ?

Well, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the
same running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't
speak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too.

Also, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and
always has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the
""pony car"" class came from) with a performance model. That's
why it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored
into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived
his baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet 
accessible--with room for performance tweaking.

The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche,
and they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least,
does well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro.

I agree.   People should not be misled to believe ""thus sayeth the Lord"" by
innuendo or opinion or speculation.

Speak directly.  If the Lord has given you something to say, say it.
But, before I declare ""thus sayeth the Lord"", I'd better know for certain
without a shadow of a doubt that I am in the correct spiritual condition
and relationship with the Lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely
certain, again, without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no
possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining
recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers.

Mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous.  For me, my greatest fears
in this area would be the following:

1--that the people would be misled
2--that people would lose respect for christianity
3--that true prophecy would be clouded by all the false prophecies
4--were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent God's Word,
   my calling would be lost forever.  God's Word would command the people
   never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet.  My
   bridges would be burnt forever.  Perhaps I could repent and be saved, but
   I could never again be a prophet of God.

In the light of this, it is critical that we speak when the Lord says speak
and that we be silent when the Lord says to be silent lest we deprive the
world of God's Word and hide it under a bushel either by our inappropriate,
cowardly silence or by our false statements.  And because of this, it
is critically important that we remain close to the Lord, in His Word, and
in prayer, and filled with the Spirit of God so that we know the difference.

In this day and age, sinners spout off their mouths left and right judging
one another, claiming ""rights"" that are not theirs, denying rights that do
indeed belong to others, demanding equal respect for all the ""gods"" of this
world, and uttering every form of falseness that promises to make one feel
good.

It's time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in
contrast against this backdrop of falsehood.  When we say, ""thus sayeth the
Lord"", it happens.  When we pray, prayer is answered because we prayed right.
When we say we're christians, we really mean it.

Where are your references?  I have been unable to find studies that state
that chromium ""cures diabetese"".  It can reduce the amount of insulin you
have to take.  ""High blood pressure"" - I have never heard of this claim
before.  ""... anabolic steroids"" - I have also never heard of this claim
before.  Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth
for God knows what reason.  Did somebody piss you off at one time?

I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely
to make a fat person thin.  But it can be the decisive component
of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an
important contribution to good health.  It is important to
exercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10).

Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase
lean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with the
statistics.  You wouldn't believe these anyway.

Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of
the essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role
in ""sensitizing"" the body's tissues to the hormone insulin.
Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity
to insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose
weight (4).

Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards
protein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This ""protein sparing""
effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets
as insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle
and organ tissue.  By ""sensitizing"" muscle to insulin,
chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters
so that they ""burn"" more fat and less muscle.  Preservation
of lean body mass has an important long-term positive
effect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the
fat they've lost.

Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding
the thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin.
Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability
of food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulin 
stimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not say
that chromium picolinate increases metabolism.

In summary, you need to change your life style in order to
loose weight and stay healthy:

  A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.
     - Eating fat makes you fat.

  B. Increase dietary fiber
     - low in calories; high in nutrients.

  C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week
     - burn calories.

  D. Take chromium picolinate daily
     - lose fat; keep muscle

The principle underlying these devices is a well establish principle in
psychology called 'entrainment,' whereby external sensory stimuli
influence gross electrical patterns of brain function.

They are 'experimental' in that people experiment with them and they
are _not_ widely (if at all) used in medicine for therapeutic purposes.  
Given the exception of TENS and similar units used for external electrical 
stimulation, usually for pain relief, not really a light and sound machine.

They are _not_ experimental in the sense of a specific medical 
category to that effect, as with experimental drugs, as the FDA does not 
specifically regulate medical devices in the way it does pharmaceuticals.   

>I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful,

There are few reliable studies of therapeutic or enhancement effects
for mind machines, other than those relaxation-related effects found with 
meditation or self-hypnosis as well.  Reported benefits are mostly anecdotal and
subjective so far, so it's hard to generalize about their potential value.

A pretty good general non-technical introduction to a wide variety
of these devices may be found in ""Would the Buddha Wear a Walkman ?""
Some interesting background material, names of suppliers, and capsule reviews
of specific equipment.

A more important question might be whether they have enough additional
value to be worth investing in.  'Biofeedback' was found to be a legitimate
and reliable effect experimentally under certain conditions, (in that
it demonstrated that we can influence physiological processes previously 
considered purely autonomic) but never panned out as a particularly valuable 
therapeutic tool because of the skill level required and the subtlety and
temporary nature of the effects in most cases.   Maybe someone else 
has more, there used to be a whole mailing list devoted to mind machines,
somewhere on the net.

I've had neither a baby nor a kidney stone, but according to my aunt, 
who has had plenty of both, a kidney stone is worse.

Kenneth Wuest's expanded translation of the New Testament does the same - it puts the range of verse numbers next to the top of each paragraph. Being an expanded translation it is quite verbose though - more suitable for detailed study than for quick reading.

I agree with Jeff's reply.  I've never changed the brake fluid except when
having a brake job, which is usually at around 80,000 miles (alot of
freeway driving).  However, I will start to do this as preventative
maintenance on my new car.  Also, there are brake system flushing agents
that can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the
system, it can cause problems, so it's been recommended NOT to use them unless
you are 100% certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent.  Just for
your info, I was quoted a price of: labor=$29.95 and fluid=$9.95 for
flushing the brake system; this in conjunction with a break job so I don't
know if it was more without the brake job. This is in the S.F Bay Area.

Ok, much as I hate to do it, here I am posting an EVEN BETTER ""Dr. Idiot""
story.


I was in my 18th hour of labor, had been pushing for 4.5 hours and was
exhausted.  My OB and I decided to go for a csec.  The OB called in
the anesthisiologist (sp?) and asked him to help prep me for surgery.

AFTER, watching me go through a couple contractions, the anes (or anus as
I like to refer to him) said, ""Well, I am off duty now."" (still staring
between my legs at that).  The OB asked to go call whomever it was who
was on duty and ask him/her how long it would take...and if it was going
to take more than a few minutes, to please stay even though he was off duty.

The anes. went out, supposedly to call the on-call anes.   In a couple of
minutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes. had left
without even trying to get ahold of the on-call.  It was the only time 
during my labor that I swore.  The on-call anes. took 20 minutes to get
there.

Come to find out, the anes. had only just gone off duty (about 2 minutes
before) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the
next on-call got there.  Good thing for all of us (especially him) that
it was not a critical emergency.  But boy would I love to knock that
fellow's ouchie places ...just to let him be in pain a
few little minutes.

   Enclosed is an advertisement for the Defending the Faith IV
conference to be held at Franciscan University of Steubenville (Ohio)
June 25-27.  I attended DTF III last year, and plan to go again this
year.  I would recommend it highly to Catholic interested in
apologetics.  There will be lots of music, well-known Catholic speakers,
fellowship, as well as Eucharistic Liturgies Friday and Sunday.

   Registration is $85 per person, but I believe financial aid is
available if you need it.  Housing in residence halls (each of which has
its own Blessed Sacrament chapel), if desired, is $30/person for double
occupancy for two nights ($30 total). Reservations can also be made for
you at the very nearby Holiday Inn.  I think it was $47 a night there
for my single room.  Meals are available at the cafeteria (Friday dinner
through Sunday lunch) for $38 or $32, with or without breakfast,
respectively.

   Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in eastern Ohio on
US Route 22, 1/2 mile west of the Ohio River and Ohio Route 7.  Greater
Pittsburgh International Airport is less than one hour (35 miles) from
campus.

   Feel free to e-mail me if you have any question I can answer.

   Here is the agenda, as typed in by a friend of mine:

Friday afternoon special:

Reflections on C.S. Lewis, a preliminary session with Walter Hooper.
Walter Hooper is one of the foremost international experts on the
writings of C.S. Lewis.  In 1963, he served as secretary to C.S. Lewis,
and he has since edited 18 of Lewis' literary works for publication.
Walter was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1965, serving
in Oxford, England, until he entered the Catholic Church in 1988.

I tried Prozac a few months ago, and had some insomnia from it, but no
anxiety or jitters.  I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the
Prozac had done any good, but it only provided a tiny benefit.  Maybe
because the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after a
20mg dose didn't work.

Now I'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft (another serotonin
reuptake inhibitor like Prozac).  One pill/day (50mg) seemed to help some. 
Now I'm trying 100mg/day.  Zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than
Prozac.  I think my doctor said that only 4% of the people taking Zoloft
have to discontinue it because of side effects.  The only problem I'm
having is some minor GI distress, but nothing too annoying.  Hopefully the
Zoloft will work.  Maybe your friend should try this one next.

My psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin
drugs, usually Prozac.  If that works, great.  If it works but has too many
side effects, try Zoloft or maybe Paxil.  If the serotonin drugs don't work
at all, try one of the tricyclics like desipramine.

>...suggestions as to the next step?

Having a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big
difference.  My psychiatrist claims that most GPs and FPs don't have much
experience in this area, and from what I've seen I'm inclined to believe
him.  I think I know more about antidepressants than the people at my
family practitioner's office.

Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor; what I know about this comes from talking to
my psychiatrist and reading sci.med.

  A weekly dialogue with a local pastor on the news of the day

                   -= THIS WEEK'S THOUGHTS =-

Last week the Supreme Court refused without comment to hear an
appeal by Rensselaer, IN, school officials desiring the
distribution of Bibles in their public schools (REL65, 5/21). A
lower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible-
distribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The
ACLU's Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court's action
protected the ""religious neutrality of our public schools."" He also
said that schools must serve students of ""all faiths and none.""
Schools were not to be a ""bazaar where rival religious groups
compete for converts,"" according to Lynn.

Several Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in
hospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of
similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on
sidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools.
They tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their
children receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to
continue their work at a distance, but find the school's position
somewhat disheartening.

I understand rationally and logically the court's position. And, I
can see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other
hand, when does ""neutrality"" become ""nihilism?"" When does plurality
turn into no position at all?

I see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms
but not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.

The other is that while we are seeking ""religious neutrality"" in
our schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced
""religious neutrality"" for the past seventy years--are making the 
Bible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St.
Petersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100
public school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had
requested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is
president of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly
invited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the
students and are given class time to explain its contents. I
remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and
speaking to the university students standing under a statue of
Lenin. Now, that's ironic!

I admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths
have equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To
allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like
atmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions
and provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality
of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public
arena acknowledges it as valid.

However--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the
distribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our
schools only signals once again our culture's movement away from a
singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make
moral and ethical decisions.

John,

I agree that the ""home"" ain't what it used to be, and some homes
are NOT the place to learn value-based sexuality. I still believe
that this is where the church can come into play. I know, those
families you speak of may not come to a church to seek information,
but the help does not need to be in a church building...I believe
that the youth from the families you mentioned will probably
disregard the value-free information at school, too.

Agreed!  I own a Mercury Villager and I'm very impressed with the V6 and

You guys are correct.  The Bricklin was produced in Canada.
The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa

it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room.
It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they

       If you are questioning whether or not ""hating sin"" is consistent with
   Christianity; I ask you to consider the following Scripture:

       Romans 12:9 ""Let Love be without hypocrisy.  Hate what is evil, cling
                    to what is good.""

       What is it that Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is
   calling us to hate?  Would God call us to do something that would
   eventually lead to hating our fellow man; especially when he commands us to
   do the opposite, to love your fellow man?

   >Consider some sin. Now lets apply our ""hate the sin..."" philosophy and see
   >what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the
   >stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so
   >strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to
   >hate the sinner.

       That has not been my experience.  I've not found myself hating anybody
   as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life.  As a sinner
   myself, I find myself having more compassion for the person.  Jesus too,
   since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are, is
   able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall.  Jesus is our
   very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner.  In the account of
   the woman caught in adultery (John 8), Jesus had compassion on the woman;
   BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin.  This is what it means to
   love sinners but hate their sin; it means loving them unconditionally,
   while at the same time calling them to leave their sin.

   >In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things
   >which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe
   >what they are doing is a sin).

       The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the
   Christian.  I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely
   pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it.  It was not unloving
   for the Christian to call me out of sin; in fact, I believe it was the most
   loving thing that that person could have done.  He loved me enough to want
   to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin.

   >After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don't
   >love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and
   >drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build
   >love.

       Again, I don't think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of
   the Christian.  If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners (exemplified
   in John 8) and the sinner hates us for it, then we have done the best we
   can.  We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and
   they will have rejected it.

Hi fellow auto enthusiasts!

Does anyone have any info on the new 4 valve per cylinder diesels Mercedes
is working on?  Any specs on outputs, engine size, will they be direct or 
indirect injection?,  etc. would be welcome.  From what I hear these should

Does anyone know of any studies done on the long-term health effects of a
man's vasectomy on his female partner?

I've seen plenty of study results about vasectomy's effects on men's health,
but what about women? 

For example, might the wife of a vasectomized man become more at risk for,
say, cervical cancer?  Adverse effects from sperm antibodies?  Changes in the
vagina's pH?  Yeast or bacterial infections?

Outside of study results, how about informed speculation?

Hi Frank:

I've read it a couple of times and I think that it is excellent.
Christiandom has needed this book for some time now. I suggest that
*every* Christian read it.

According to Hank, they printed 15 times more than Harvest House
usually prints for the first printing, and it still sold out in
the first week. It is in it's second printing, and most Christian
book stores have waiting lists. You can order it directly from CRI

Like we have never heard of, or read these verses before?

How about you read them in context, taking into consideration the times and 
places in which they were written; the local customs and pagan rituals; 
what the surrounding verses are talking about and how they interact with 
the rest of the Bible.

There are many issues in the Bible that are argued, and can be argued 
successfullly from both sides of an issue.  Some examples that come to mind
are 
		Gifts of the Spirit
		when the Rapture will occur(pre or post tribulation)
		how people should be baptized
to name a few.

I have found nothing in scripture that condemns me, or anyone else, for having
a monogamous relationship with the person whom I love, even if we are the
same sex.

I'm sorry if I am coming across as heated.  It's just that the Lord has been
so dear to me the last several years and I'm tired of hearing this same old
thing from people who believe what their told rather than finding out for 
themselves.

Check it out for yourself.  Invite the Holy Spirit to guide you.  If I weren't
confident of this I wouldn't invite you to do this.

Note the difference here. One is saying, if *Christ* disagrees with 
a Christian being gay, *Christ* can change that.

The other is saying, if *I* think being gay is wrong, that a Christian
cannot be gay, *I* need to tell them to change.

Recently we have found TIFF manipulation packages which do not recognize
TIFF files output by xv.  This is due to a missing XRESOLUTION and YRESOLUTION
tag which apparently is required (or at least believed to be required) for
valid TIFF.  I have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these
do indeed copy these tags.

Has anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags?
I have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but
that directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.  I
hope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it, but would prefer
to find code already known to work in xv.

:  [....] The narrower view that a hacker, when
:  associated with the computing environment, is a dishonest
:  expert is not so widespread, I'm my opinion, at least with the
:  people involved with the field. IMHO the wider meaning is not
:  obsolete at all, no matter how much the lay press would like it to
:  be!  [....]

:  Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker, and somebody
:  perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very
:  small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know
:  the wider (and original) meaning of the word.  [....]

Unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark
recesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view
given to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker'
is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.

I, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider
themselves such.  Following is the definition from ""Jargon File 2.9.10"".
(This is also known as the ""Hackers Dictionary"".)  The definitions are
arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:

   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.
     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable
     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most
     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who
     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys
     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A
     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is
     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,
     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX
     hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who
     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One
     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the
     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing
     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to
     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password
     hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.

     The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global
     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and
     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described
     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see
     {hacker ethic, the}).

     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe
     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an
     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new
     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego
     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if
     you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled
     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.

   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing
     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of
     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and
     facilitating access to information and to computing resources
     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun
     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits
     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.

     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no
     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe
     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and
     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that
     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary
     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}
     project.

     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of
     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.
     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who
     see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On
     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy
     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,
     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it
     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an
     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.

     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker
     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share
     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing
     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as
     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})
     can function without central control because of this trait; they
     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be
     hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.

:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is
:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.
: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who
: says ""Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..."" :-)

Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing
limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better
not to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So,
in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary
to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the
workplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known
and respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.

: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way.
:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)

Language works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is
to communicate.  To oversimplify: As long as communication is taking place,
then language is working.

I have several isolation amplifier boards that are the ideal interface
for EEG and ECG.  Isolation is essential for safety when connecting
line-powered equipment to electrodes on the body.  These boards
incorporate the Burr-Brown 3656 isolation module that currently sells
for $133, plus other op amps to produce an overall voltage gain of
350-400.  They are like new and guaranteed good.  $20 postpaid,
schematic included.  Please email me for more data.

Suppose someone said that he was sure that he would return from death,
in glory and power, flying in the clouds with the host of heaven,soon, within
the lifetimes of those then standing with him - and 2000 years went by without
any such event. [He also asserted, so they say, himself to be God.]

2 questions:

	1) Is that one of those ""false prophecies"" you were talking about?
	2) Does that make the speaker a false prophet?

Uhh,  Has it occurred to you that there is no way to know any of these
things, for certain, ""without the tiniest shadow of a doubt""? That people
who thought they did have also been deluded?

Those of us who believe in actually being able to _CHECK_ our opinions
have an out - we can check against some external reality. Those who
assert that beliefs entertained without evidence, or even despite evidence
have a special virtue (ie. ""faith"") are out of luck -- and this is the
result.

You want to demonstrate Christian honesty? Great.

I saw the same thing happen to my father, and I can more or less validate your
take on hospitals.  It seems to me that medical science understands precious
little about taking care of the human machine.  Drugs are given as a
response to symptoms (and I guess that makes sense since all the studies that 
validate the effectiveness of those drugs are based on a narrow
assessment of the degree of particular symptoms).  But there seems
to be very little appreciation for the well-being of a person
outside of the numbers that appear on a test.  I watched my dad
wither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissue
while in the hospital.  There is something a little crazy about a
system in which there is more attention paid to giving you every
latest drug available than there is attention paid to whether you
have had enough to eat to prevent loss of muscle tissue.  It is
really, really bizarre.

On the subject of the V4,Ford in the UK used V4 engines exstensively in
their Ford Transit vans.This brings back a memory from the seventies.I
played in a band at the time and for something like 180 pounds four of
us bought a 1967 ""tranny"" to cart the gear around in.It was in terrible
shape (cosmetically) because it's last owner was a pig farmer.We spent
days cleaning it up and putting in a partition and more seating but 'til
the day it died everytime you turned on the fan to the defroster dried
pig shit came flying out the vents!!!.
    Back to the engine if I remember right it was a 1600cc V4 and that
thing could haul,we could fill it with equipment and up to 8 people and
it went like a bat out of hell,of course there were no pollution controls
on the engine and the gas was leaded and higher octane than we get now.
    When the mechanical fuel pump quit we put in an electric one from a 
Morris Minor that worked great. Ah fond memories.

Yes, it is true. Someone has published a rebuttal pointing out
certain flaws in the argument, and recently Professor C Anthony
Anderson, of the Philosophy Department of the University of
Minnesota, has written a revised version of the argument, perhaps
free of flaws, and at any rate free of the flaws complained of in

I forgot exactly what her age was but I remember clearly
that she was born in a family of poverty and she did not
have any education, whatsoever, at the age of the apparitions.
She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were
living in a prison cell of some sort.

She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about 
what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.  
For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since 
Bernadette did not receive any.  One time, after several apparitions
passed, The Lady finally said, ""I am the Immaculate Conception"".
So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and
over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the
priest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, the
priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, ""Do you know what
you are talking about?"".  Bernadette did not know what exactly
it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for
the priest.  The priest continued with, ""How did you remember
this if you do not know?"".  Bernadette answered honestly that
she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her
way to the priest...

The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then.
But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which
the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic
personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette.

(Note: This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which
our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her
bare hands in front of pilgrims.  At the start little
water flowed but after several years there is more water 
flowing.)

I don't know either.  Truth be known, so little is known of angels
to even guess.  All we really know is that angels ALWAYS speak in
the nativ tongue of the person they're talking to, so perhaps they
don't have ANY language of their own.

It's a common fallacy you commit.  The non-falsifiability trick.  How
can I prove it when not all the evidence may be seen?  Answer:  I
can't.  The fallacy is in assuming that it is up to me to prove 
anything.  

When I say it has never been proven, I'm talking about the ones
making the claims, not the skeptics, who are doing the proving.

The burden of proof rest with the claimant.  Unfortunately, 
(pontification warning) our legal system seems to be headed in
the dangerous realm of making people prove their innocence (end
pontification).

But truthfully, Corinthians was so poorly written (or maybe just
so poorly translated into English) that much remains unknown
about just what Paul really intended (despite claims of hard
proof one way or another).  Some will see his writings in
1 cor 12-14 as saying don't do this don't do this and using
sarcasm, metaphor, etc. while yet others take what he says literally
sarcasms and metaphors notwithstanding.

Me?  When I read 1 Cor 14 about praying/speaking in tongues regarding
building oneself/the church, I see him using compare/contrast,
saying do this because it build the church, while doing this
builds onself (implying don't do that).  It's a common usage
of writing that we all employ, and it is easily seen how it
COULD be interpreted this way.  Why some do and some don't is
a mystery.

I looked at that Bimmer yesterday. It's an '81, has about 90kmi, according
to owner (odometer stopped working at 68Kmi). Drivess well, sounds good,
body is OK, he wants $3000.
i liked the car, despite it's auto tranny, but my wife will be a primary
driver on this one, and she wants auto.
The radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn (!)
The A/C seems to have a leak. 
The sunroof is sticky, but operational.
Odometer does not work, as mentioned before.
Idle is a bit bouncy, going from 900rpm to 1200rpm.
Wipers are slow.
That's teh gripes. The owner says that he changed radiator, alternator, 
rotors and calipers, exhaust.
The biggest problem, is that the owner is a shifty SOB, telling strange
stories. I hate that. I would never buy from a persom like that, except, how
often you see a descent 528i for that amount of money. He also said that,
although I could bring a mechanicin, he wouldn't let me check the car by taking

Greg,
No flame intended, but I think you just missed one of the rare attempts of
humor in sci.skeptic.
""Krillean"" against ""Kirilian"". Get it?
;-)

BTW, I think you're a bit of base yourself, since, to my knowledge, the
electromagnetic field around a stone is rather abscent. But still, a stone
has a nice ""aura"" on the Kirilian photographs.

Don't remember excactly, but ""corona discharge"" I think is a more fitting
expression than aura. Think you'll find something on this in the skeptic-faq.

	Probably the most famous V16 is the one Cadillac made from about 1925  
to 1935.  They had to scale down then because the Great Depression really put  
the crimp on luxury cars.  It had 452 cubic inches with over two hundred horse  
power.  ""They don't make them like they used to.""  
	There were others though.  Packard had one until about 1930 whe it down  
sized to their legendary Twin-Six, their mainstay for the next twenty years.   
Lincoln and Pierce Arrow might have also had one but I am not two sure.

V16 if they did not actually produce them.  There was actually a ""cylinder war""

justify all you want.  extended warranties are a ripoff, high profit item for
the dealer.  and you didn't buy 5yr/60k, you get 3yr/36k *free*, so what you
bought is 2yr/24k.  and you still have to pay $50 every time you use this 
great 'warranty'.  better to put your money in the bank and use it for repairs
if/when you need it.  considering that your last car was only 1.5 years old,
are you sure you will even keep this new one past it's *free* warranty period?
btw, typical profit on extended warranties is around 80%.  that's right, only
20% of the money needs to go into the collective pot to pay for any future
repairs that the group of extended-warranty-people collect.

Luke 16 talks about the rich man and Lazarus. Matthew 25 talks about 
the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Revelations
20 and 21 reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are
thrown. Matthew 18 talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and
the fire of hell. It seems quite clear that there is this place where
a fire burns forever. From the Revelations passages it is clear that
the devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. From the
Matthew 25 passage it doesn't seem abundantly clear whether the
punishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or
in the sense of continual. 
 
From Dale's question, I come away with the suggestion that hell,
if it were short, might be an acceptable alternative to living
forever with the Source of Life, Peace and Joy i.e. the 
unbeliever ceases to exist. Whereas, if punishment goes on
continually, then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it.
It definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid
regardless of its exact nature. 

There seem to be two main questions in Dale's thought:
What is God's main plan on earth?
Why is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed
to simply destroying completely those who refuse God?

I believe that God's main plan is to have a genuine relationship
with people.

The nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more
difficult to ascertain. It does seem clear that hell is something
to avoid. At a minimum, hell is the state one is in when one has
nothing to do with God.

In the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of
hell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment. For instance,
it is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can
continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or
whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is
burned up. If you can forgive the graphicalness, if you throw a
physical body into a fire, assuming the person starts out alive,
at some fairly quick point, the nerves are destroyed and pain is
no longer sensed. It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement,
the unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell
i.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical
pain. What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are
to be forever without God. 
 
The Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener
think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people
won't listen to God even after he rises from the dead. The point of
the parable is to reach the hard-hearted here who are not listening
to the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ.
It seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is
not even remotely pleasant.

Maybee you should persuade your burea that for only $650 they can become much

  Easy vs. Hard .....Easy on who?

I had a rare very personal talk with my mother last year.  She said
that when she and my father were raising we four children, they
did not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised
in their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be
alienated from them and it would create problems.
  In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They
raised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable
demands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.
  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and
never absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God
never involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that
I may someday be held responsible for the things that offended
Him...sins that the ""world"" told me were OK.
  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised
four extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more
complete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice
and punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many
grave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married
and divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for
change...but I shouldn't have married to person in the first place )
and more....
  My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing
us to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by
accepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or
counsel.
  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they
*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls
because you must speak up and say what is unpopular and
difficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able
to say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and
compassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not
want to hear and will stay away from you.
  This life is ""but dust"". As long as the comfort of this life
is our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those
with whom we come in contact.
  I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who
support the ""right"" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality,
or who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in
this time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving
friend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me that
what I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around me
living the same way I was and they seemed like good, decent
people. (wouldn't kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..)
It is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer
life to hear the Holy Spirit than it is to hear a loving friend.
Think about this the next time the Holy Spirit tells you that
a friend is in error, but you don't want to ""cause trouble"".
Righteous prayers is great power, but don't forget that we are
we are Christ's lips and hands on earth. Don't be afraid to
simply voice Truth when the situation calls for it. Say a
fervent prayer and ask the Holy Spirit for Love and guidance.
In more ways than we may realize, we *are* our brother's
keeper.

Elizabeth

Well 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel
seems like a bit excessive. I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel
of 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.

Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to
represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.

Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)
frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture
to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous
frame) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.

>(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)

Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+
card with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24
bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.

Mind you the card costs more than your workstation.

This is curious. I read in _EH_...

""The Lord imparted the gift of knowledge to James the Just, to John 
and Peter after his resurrection, these delivered it to the rest of 
the apostles, and they to the seventy, of whom Barnabas was one.""

It seems that the Lord imparted the gift of knowledge, not that the
Lord imparted secret information.

I'm afraid that I cannot find this portrayal in _EH_. 
I don't see anywhere in 3:32:7-8 where Eusebius mentions that certain 
gnostics had the wrong gnosis.

The closest is when Eusebius summarizes Hegesippus' statements, 
""...whilst if there were any at all, that attempted to pervert 
the sound doctrine of the saving gospel, they were yet skulking 
in dark retreats...""

""Favorably interpreted?"" Just in looking at two of the four 
references that you gave (I have the _EH_ handy, Irenaeus and the 
_Clemetine Recognitions_ I will have to look for) I see no room for 
such 'interpretations.'

And any such 'interpretation' still falls short of an equivalence to 
the Temple Ceremonies. 

The links for Jay's using _EH_ for support are: ""imparting the gift 
of knowledge"" = ""imparted secret information"" = ""being given secret 
signs and tokens to gain entrance to heaven.""  But there is not
enough equivalence between the the ideas for us to be able to call 
this ""favorable interpretation.""  It appears to be closer to 
""fabrication.""

Eve'.

I am looking to buy 4 new p195-50r15 tires.. (R or HR). I don't
have much to spend, but I would like a tire that will LAST. Does
anyone have any experience with the following brands?

	Riken
	Falken	
	BFG	
	General	

There are others, but these I can find here for under $70.. Like
I said, I am mostly interested in threadwear then speed, since I
hardly get to drive them over 80 or 90 mph. Also, is it true that
""noone will give you warranty on such tires"", according to
a tire dealer?

Finally, do HR tires last longer than R tires (threadwear again),
or is that strictly a speed factor?

Thanks for any replies..

	Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's 
	Contest Announcement)

WHAT IS ACCESS.bus?

ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer 
peripheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that 
uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to 
a single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or 
keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR 
gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and 
others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications 
such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, 
Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more 
can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts 
Plug and Play on every PC.

The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of 
systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host 
computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a 
number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software 
development.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-
platform use of the same device.

ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:
=====================================

ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone 
to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without 
fee or royalty.
ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single 
host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus 
data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.

ACCESS.bus Physical Layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware 
protocol, with one data line and one clock line.
Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level 
handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock 
synchronization.  

ACCESS.bus Software Protocols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three 
levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.

I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines 
arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C 
provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with 
different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, 
framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the 
receiver.  

BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between 
a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the 
ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an 
ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with 
additional semantics, including checksum.
Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot 
plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus 
addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot 
plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the 
system is running, without rebooting.

APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus 
protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular 
types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application 
Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: 
keyboards, locators, and text devices.

ACCESS.bus support on the PC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the 
PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the 
base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  
An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 
- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with 
the ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for 
multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and 
Windows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples 
of the interface from applications to the device drivers.

You've missed on very important passage.

2 Thess. 1:6-10
 For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who
afflict you, and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when
the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming
fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do
not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. And these will pay the penalty of
eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of
His power, when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be
marveled at among all who have believed-- for our testimony to you was
believed.

Things to note from this passage.  Unbelievers are both those who openly reject
the gospel, and those who do not know God.  The eternal destruction is the same
as the eternal hope in 2:16.  This distructions primarily emphasize that it is
separation from the presence of God.  THe context is speaking of the 2nd advent
while 2:1 is speaking of the rapture.  Don't confuse the two.

If this was like earthly fire that requires a gas producing substance to
ignite.
However, there seems to be a different type of fire as expressed in the burning
bush that was not consumed.  Also, the Daniel acct. shows that the laws of
nature can be interupted even with earthly fire.

>It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement,

Maybe you don't understand.  There will be those who are alive at the end of
the millenium, who will walk straight into the GWTJ.  Even those who have died
in their sin will be resurrected, i.e. reunited with their physical body, to
receive condemnation.

>i.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical pain.

This is contrary to the teaching of Scripture.

THis is conjecture at best if you are using it to support the ""no physical
body"" thesis.

The true awlfulness of hell, is that it is eternal separation from God, after
having seen the glory of His presence at the GWTJ.  But whether it was open
rebellion against the revealed gospel of Christ or if it is not having known
GOd (not saught Him as He is), then as Paul says, they are without excuss and
that every mouth will be stopped.  There will be no defense at the judgment
seat of God. THerefore we understand ""it is appointed unto man once to die, and
then comes judgment"" literally.  

just because it is horrific, doesn't make it less of a reality.  
it should compel those of us who have the riches of Christ to share it with
others

Not alone at all. My old 83 Accord (now in the hands of a sibling) has a much
better engagement of the clutch. Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater 
feels better in this aspect. Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and
140,000 kms respectively. My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every 
respect except smooth clutch engagement. Of course the Kawasaki is the best

No.  It is very relevant.  Homosexual acts and acts of beastiality are
topically aranged together in the law.  This is very important.
Anyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality
deals with temple prostitution (and I think you would agree that there
is no proof for this.)  If the Law reveals the character of God, and 
is ""holy, just, and good"" as is written in the New Testament, then
those who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals acts
to be biggots have to address this passage of Scripture.  

Why must we only discuss Scriptures that involve consensual human
adult relationships?  Isn't that bordering on sophistry?  The point
we are making is that God did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts.
Not everyone who brings up these Scriptures is just trying to use and emotional
argument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors.
The issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly.  

I do not have problem with a loving, nonlustful relationship with a member
of the same sex.  I have them, and we all do.  The issue at hand is 
the sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex, or lusting after.
So other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation. 

And the idea that these relationships may be  emotional  relationships
between adult humans is red herring.  We all agree that it is okay 
for adults to  have caring relationships with one another.

Unless the patient has a very short life expectancy, the possible complications
from a hernia that hasn't been repaired far outweigh the risks of surgery.
The risks of surgery, anyway, are minimal. Unless they are exceedingly large,
hernias can be fixed under local anesthesia. 
Don't forget that hernias are one the leading causes of small bowel obstruction.
And the smaller the hernia is, the higher the chances that a loop of bowel will
become incarcerated or strangulated.

This must vary from state to state, because our old company Kemper wanted
to drop me (keeping my wife) or tripple our premium because i had 1 ticket.
Only 2 points for 10 mph over speed limit.  Well i called Geico, and they
insured both my wife and i for less then we were previously paying
Kemper.

Generally i hate the whole insurance game. I realize that it is necessary
but the way that a person can get dicked around doesn't make any sense.

This is not a very sound argument for baptising babies. It assumes that
if the Bible doesn't say specifically that you don't need to do something,
then that must mean that you do need to do it. I know there's a specific
term for this form of logic, but it escapes me right now. However, if it
were sound, then you should be able to apply it this way; If the Bible
doesn't specifically say that something is wrong, then it must be OK,
which, coincidentally, leads perfectly into a question I've often pondered.
If slavery is immoral (which I believe it is, can I assume that everyone
else in this group does too?), why doesn't Jesus or any of the apostles
speak out against it? Owning slaves was common practice back then. Paul
speaks about everything else that is immoral. He apparently thought it
was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard. Why
doesn't anyone mention slavery? If God's morals are eternal and don't
change like the morals of society, then it must have been just as immoral then
as it is today.

I've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, and
that it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for the
greater volume. My Internist, who diagnosed my AV block, slow heart rate
and PVC's, told me something different. She says that heart rate is
associated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not its
size. Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but the
effects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block, she
asserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even when
exercise is dicontinued. PVC's are also common in runners. 

So my EKG puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart
patients. Isn't that strange, though? Are there any not-so-beneficial
aspects to athlete's heart? Is it all good?

My suggestion look at your current insurance card, there will be a name 
accross the top telling you which insurance company you are insured by.
Call information in Houston and get the number of a branch office in the 
Houston area, call the insurance company.

Your rates will vary depending on the amount of coverage you want,
do you want to carry comp and collision (probably not on an 82),
what your driving record is.  You mentioned none of these things in your
posting so how can anyone give you accurate information.

Like I said, pick up the phone and make a few calls, it won't kill you.

Whoa!  Watch your terminology.  ""Dealer invoice"" is *not* ""dealer cost"".
You'll hear lots of ads screaming ""two dollars over dealer invoice!!!""
Sounds like a real deal, huh?  No.  You know what the ""dealer invoice""
(also called factory invoice) is?  It's a piece of paper with numbers
on it that the factory sends the dealer.  What do the numbers
signify?  Absolutely nothing.  It's a marketing gimmick that the
salesman can wave in your face to impress you.  Note that nowhere
on the ""invoice"" does it claim to be the real price of the car, and
most ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast,
low voice saying something like ""invoice may not reflect actual
dealer cost"".  Actually, I *guarantee* it does not reflect actual
dealer cost.

Also, the reasonable profit for dealer is usually around three percent.
Adjust according to the dealer cost of the car and any options that
you want.  Haggle like hell with the salesman over the cost of
""dealer prep"" and ""protection package"" (i.e. a few squirts of
paint and fabric protectant).  While you're at it, ask the salesman
to toss in a thing or two that doesn't cost him any cash.  My 
wife and I got a joyride in a twin-turbo Mitsubishi 3000GT when

Lets talk about principles. If we accept that God sets the
standards for what ought to be included in Scripture - then we
can ask:
1. Is it authoritative?
2. Is it prophetic?
3. Is it authentic?
4. Is it dynamic?
5. Is it received, collected, read and used?

On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.
To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:
1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
anachronisms.
2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices
which are at variance with sacred Scripture.
3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of
subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.
4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine
Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and
poetic and religious feeling.

But the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that
the Hebrew canon included the Apocrapha in the first place, and
it wasn't until the sixteenth century that Luther and co. threw
them out. The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn't
accept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical
precedence for their actions. Jerome only translated the
apocrapha under protest, and it was literally 'over his dead
body' that it was included in the catholic canon.

How do you then view the words: ""I warn everyone who  hears the
words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to
them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.
And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will
take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the
holy city"" (Rev 22.18-9)
Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.

It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude. He had no
argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John
10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus 
that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the 
OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51
taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say
Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture.

	Ok, so in my ongoing search for a sport utility, here's the latest;


Toyota 4runner:

	 Small. Small Small Small. The interior of this vehical is impossible
	for a large person. Too bad; it would have been the winner otherwise.

Nissan Pathfinder:
	
	Very low ceiling. My head hit the roof, Fun on bumps, no? Also has
	a cheap-looking interior.

Isuzu Trooper:

	Class act. This is a really, really nice vehical. Very comfortable,
	handled ok. Has really cool grab handles EVERYWHERE. But it's huge,
	and the engine is a bit too small for it's bulk; also the manual shift is 
	weird and kind of awkward. I'd buy this if it were $3k cheaper or 10""
	shorter. But at this size and for this price, no. I kept picturing trying to 
	park in in San Francisco. No Thanks.


Chevy Blazer:

	Cheap looking. Small. Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan, but still 
	too small.

Ford Explorer:

	This is no sports car, and it's certainly not for the serious off roader.
	But it's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the
	trooper. It's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving, though it would
	be nice if it had a *bit* more. The automatic tranny is pretty nice; head and
	shoulders above my '90 mazda MPV. The steering is not as tight as I'd like,
	but it's acceptable. The two door has easy-to-enter back seats (Easier to get
	into, in fact, than the driver's seat of the 4runner!) and with a 10"" shorter
	wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny, (Yes, I'm a manual 
	shift biggot, I admit it...) it's the one I'm thinking of buying. 


	So, that said, is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it?
	Anyone had any major problems? Heard any horror stories? 

	Also, any reason to buy the ford over the mazda Navajo, both being essentially
	the same vehical?

Yeah, right. Real muscle cars had a manual transmission, and their
clutches aren't that heavy. Shelby-American used plenty of
high-powered, high-torque engines, and Carroll only put autos in
his cars because people wanted them. (Blasphemers! Heretics!
Burn them, burn them for defiling a Shelby with an auto! ;-)
Real Cobras (and they were the ultimate sports car at the
time) had big-block Fords which turned out prodigious amounts
of power and torque, and _none_ of them had automatics. 

>And also, an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive.

Yeah, if you call a gear shift in the middle of a curve ""fun."" :-)

I personally would _love_ to have a '66 Galaxie 500 7-Liter Coupe,
with a fire-breathing 427 and four-onna-floor (to go along side
my '66 Galaxie 500 pillarless hardtop with a fire-breathing 390
with three-onna-tree; I love the sound of dual exhaust in the
morning! :-). There's no comparison between a REAL American
Muscle Car and a car with a big engine and an automatic, IMHO.

Do we attach some meaning of the Israelites entering ""the promised land"" to 
Christianity?

   I submit God did not hold the children responsible when the adults chose 
to follow the bad report of the 10 spies over Joshua and Caleb.  This is 
recorded for us in Deuteronomy 1:39 ""Moreover your little ones, which ye said 
should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge 
between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give 
it, and they shall possess it.""

   At least to me it seems there was/is an age, or point in maturity where 
they were/are held responsible, and could not enter the ""Promised Land"", 
younger ones were not held to the same ""rules"", at least not by God.

They changed the lights and slope of the hood, along with the new
grille.  Otherwise, it is unchanged.

Interestingly, their lack of wood and lack of a grille was a BIG
design statement... they tried to defy conventional wisdom and carve
their own niche ... unfortunately, sales were only half those of the
LEXUS and hence, they now join the pack.  I still wonder if much of

     It bugs me when I see this kind of nonsense.

     First, there is no reasonable evidence linking Masonry to ancient
Egypt, or even that it existed prior to the late 14th century (and
there's nothing definitive before the 17th).

     Second, worship of Osiris is not, nor has it ever been, a part of
Masonic practice (we are strictly non-denominational).

Just to clear things up (as to why I posted the question that way)...
I was debating with a co-worker about diesels.  I claimed they were
cleaner-burning than gas engines.  He said the extra ""junk"" put out by them
was offset by the savings in greenhouse gasses.   I made all the SAME claims
you did.  But, one question of his was what about the carbon?  I said it
was harmless, but he wanted to know how to get rid of it.  I suggested
scrubbers.  (I figured it would be no harder or more expensive to install
than ""cats"".)  Does there exist any designs for a scrubber?  (I'd like
to know just to answer his final question.)  I convinced him that diesels
are cleaner otherwise.

BTW, (I named my subject ""Dirty Diesels"" because I knew it would get a reaction
out of people who knew they were cleaner than gas engines and that they'd
read it...)

I have seen it used in an Orthodox church once, although I can't recall why.
I found it odd, to say the least.  Also, I object to the statement that the
Orthodox DELETE the filioque from the original form of the Creed.

The creed originally did NOT contain that phrase, and it is not present
in the Greek original, which hangs by my desk.  Not intending to start a

Recently I've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon
cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.  In
particular, Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book ""Colon Cleansing for
Health and Longevity"" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very
similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics,
along with certain orally ingested ""debris-loosening agents"", boosts
the immune system to a significant degree.

He also plugs a unique appliance called the ""Colema Board"", which
facilitates the self-administration of colonics.  It sells for over
$100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Tox
products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash,
supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its
bulkiness.

If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its
particulars, or the Colema Board and related products, I'd be very
interested to hear about research and personal experience.

This article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches upon
fasting and cleansing through a ""ritual"" system of purification.

Howdy...  I think you would be interested in Infini-D 2.5 for the Mac.  There
is no DOS or Windows version.  It's quite an amazing program.

""Some"" of the features:

*  Bevel Text
*  Timeline based animation sequencer
*  Realtime bounding box preview
*  Object linking
*  Phong Shading
*  Ray Tracing
*  Bounding Box shading
*  Wireframe shading
*  Ghourad shading
*  Flat shading
*  Anti-aliasing (none, low, medium, high)
*  Environment maps
*  Quicktime support (wrap a QT movie around an object)
*  Procedural surfaces
*  Composed surfaces (for layering surfaces)
*  Alpha channel support
*  Import EPS, DXF, and Swivel 3D files
*  Export DXF and Swivel 3D files
*  Spline based animation
*  Animation assistant (for creating smooth movements and other stuff)
*  Object morphing (surfaces and bevels morph too)

... And lots more that I can't remember right now...

Anyway, it's not as expensive as some of the other animation/rendering
packages.  I think you can get it for around $699 from MacWarehouse.
They also have educational discounts...

Well, hope that helps a bit.

See ya...

	This is true, but it's not quite the whole story.  There were 
	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology
	who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'

    One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography
    is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the
    hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagnetic
    or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at London's
    City University, and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research 
    named A. J. Ellison.

    After years of studying the method and the claims, Ellison
    came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we
    calls 'Lichtenberg Figures,' an effect of intermittent ionization of
    the air around the object.  It's a bit more complicated than
    'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing
    in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited
    value (if any) than was previously widely thought.  Electrical and
    magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be
    of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and
    usually also tracer chemicals.

Subject: Traveling Fatima (was Re: Consecration and Anniversary)
Lines: 48

Hello.
I just like to share this rosary and other prayer propagation
practice we do in my country.  I am not sure if it is going on
also here in the US or any other country.  In all these 4 1/2
yrs. I've been here in Illinois, USA, I have not encountered
it.  May I just call it ""Traveling Fatima"" since I don't know
of an exact translation of what we call it in my native language.

For certain regions in a district in a town or city, an image/
statue of our Lady of Fatima is moved from one home (originating
from owner) to another.  This will stay with that family for
one (1) week and this family is required to pray the rosary and
other prayers (prayer sheets accompany the image) to our Lady
of Fatima.  The move will be like a simple procession of folks
picking up the image from its current 'home' after 'departing'
prayers and proceeds to move it to the next home which has the
prior notification about the move.  There will be the 'receiving'
prayers at the next home to welcome our Lady of Fatima image
there.  It does not have to be that only members of the family
in that home who must pray to the image.  They may invite others
(or others/friends can invite themselves in ;^)) to participate
during prayer time in that 'new' home everyday for one week.
This image is moved from one family to the next within the
bounded region of that district, until it goes back to the owner
of the image.

This is probably going on around there (Philippines) right now
(or somebody correct me when exactly since I forgot) and every
year, this is part of our devotion to our Lady of Fatima.

It has been easy to facilitate this back home because it is more
likely that your next door neighbor is a Catholic and the image
then is just moved next door.

I am thinking of starting something like it in the village where
my sister and her family lives.  Most of our friends and neighbors
there are Catholics and practicing ones.

I'd like to know if there are any state/community laws that this 
practice will violate, whatsoever, before I go for it.  Thank you 
for any comments or help about this matter.

This is not at all comparable. Christianity is the main stream in
western culture. You are trivializing the experiences of others.

I remember what it was like being ""different"" as a Christian. We
were told all the time that we were different, and in fact that
only members of the our church were really Christians (though others
who believed in God weren't as bad as atheists), so we were a small
minority. That was nothing compared to being an atheist.

The only thing comparable would be a young child being Christian
being surrounded by staunch atheists, including parents, who
actively persecute any religious tendancies - both actual punishments
and, even worse, emotional blackmail. They would also have
to have the whole mainstream society on their side. Maybe these
conditions could have occured in the old Soviet Union* not in a
country with ""under God"" in its pledge of allegiance.

* I doubt it even then, because children have to be taught to be
Christians and hence must have support somewhere.

Yes. My atheism was ""born of necessity."" For an intellectually honest
person belief is mostly a response to evidence. Will or wishes have
nothing to do with it. I could choose to lie, or to be silent about
my true beliefs. I could no more choose to believe in the God of
Christianity than I could decide that the ordinary sky looks red to
me. Still I should be clear that I'm not equating what I went through
with what gays go through. However it is a mistake to assume that
everyone who goes through painful experiences are broken by them.
Happily some are made stronger, once we get past it.

Not without going to details and violating the confidences of some of my
childhood friends. Suffice it say to that religion does not guarantee
that a person will be happy and strong emotionally, and a repressive
upbringing can leave its scars even, or especially, on those who don't
get free of it. I doubt that any sane and sincere person doubts that and
I feel no need to defend it.

By the way I am much happier and stronger being out of the closet. In
the end it has been, as someone eloquently put it in private email, an
experience of liberation rather than disillusion.

I have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. Last summer I
couldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden
before one or several wasps would come for me. I am asking for advice
on how to repel wasps.

   This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one
of my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care
of them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year we
couldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest
in my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vie
for the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin or
spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards?
Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved
plants, I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone
else.

   Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? The wasps seem
to come to drink at them, and I suppose that their prey will breed in
them. The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as soon
as the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bath.

Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, they
seem to love me. The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about
wasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. I've got some painful
stings when trying to follow that advice. I have also tried to use
hygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. They still love me,
and come for me, even when I'm in the middle of a crowd. So far only
two things seem to work: To kill it dead or to run into the house and
close all doors and windows. 

NB: I don't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees, just wasps.

  Ok, let me see if I can get all this out concisely.  I am on an
information gathering venture regarding the various expressions of
Christianity/churches there are.  
        My husband and I come from very different, but completely
Christian backgrounds.  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a
born and raised Church of Christ member.  At first I agreed with a lot
of what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgical
based Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based.
However over the last year, I've been regretting changing to the
Church of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not a
fundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are
socio-cultural in nature and don't relate to the Christian doctrine.
One of my sorest spots is the role of women.  I believe that through
Mary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but
in the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I
am told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser
member, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear that
verse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role in
anything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men
(ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).   The last straw
was when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college
groups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the
study.
Also my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church
feels that if you aren't a conservative republican - you aren't a REAL
Christian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call
themselves a Christian).  Hence we are subjected during the service to
long prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with.  We are
also don't agree with the C of C's dread of any new ""movement"" being
led by the young people.

So, we have been church hunting with NO success.  I want a reasonably
biblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter
what their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women).
Christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious
convictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still
bring their Bibles to service.

We are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find a
place where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and
without reservation.  If anyone can point us in a direction we'd be
thrilled!
I'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and
even harder for me to stay churchless for long.

any responses would be welcome

[I would think somewhere in the Baptist spectrum you might find what
you're looking for.  However the issue is probably more one of the
flavor of the specific local churches in your area than the
denomination -- Baptists cover quite a spectrum.  Adult baptism sort
of narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum.
Historically that's been associated with movements that have the
character you're trying to avoid.  --clh]

 I have a copy of 'The Earth-From Space' on my wall that I purchased
from Space Shots, Inc. (LA, CA  (800) 272-2779).  As printed on the
poster, the image was created by Tom Van Sant and the GeoSphere Project.
The image IS copyrighted, so I doubt that you'll find it legally in
the public domain.  Part of the proceeds from the sale of the image go to the 
GeoSphere Project (an environmental education thing), and the cost is
nominal, so crack a 20 and buy one!  Also, I don't think it's always
safe to assume that just because the government 'funded' a project, any
products will be provided for free.  Many government agencies (NASA, NOAA)
and some private groups (National Geographic) provided assistance to the
GeoSphere Project.  This collaboration seems to be mostly oriented to
educating the public, rather than pure research.

Hi Bruce.  How do you reconcile this practice with Ezekiel 18?
Ezekiel 18:20 ""The soul who sins is the one who will die.  The son will not
share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the
son.  The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and
the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.""

Is Ezekiel 18 not translated correctly in your eyes perhaps?

I forgot exactly what her age was but I remember clearly
that she was born in a family of poverty and she did not
have any education, whatsoever, at the age of the apparitions.
She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were
living in a prison cell of some sort.

She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about 
what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.  
For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since 
Bernadette did not receive any.  One time, after several apparitions
passed, The Lady finally said, ""I am the Immaculate Conception"".
So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and
over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the
priest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, the
priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, ""Do you know what
you are talking about?"".  Bernadette did not know what exactly
it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for
the priest.  The priest continued with, ""How did you remember
this if you do not know?"".  Bernadette answered honestly that
she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her
way to the priest...

The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then.
But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which
the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic
personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette.

(Note: This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which
our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her
bare hands in front of pilgrims.  At the start little
water flowed but after several years there is more water 
flowing.)

Subject: Committing my life to God?
Organization: Edinburgh University
Lines: 42

Hi everyone,

I'm trying to find my way to God, but find it difficult as I can't hear
God talking to me, letting me know that he exists and is with me and
that he knows me, and I feel that I can't possibly get to know him until
he does. Maybe he _is_ talking to me but I just don't know or understand
how to listen.

Some Christians tell me that (in their opinion) the only way to find God
is to take a plunge and commit your life to him, and you will discover.
This idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit
frightening, but I have a few questions.

1) How do you actually commit yourself? If I just say, ""OK God, her you
go, I'm committing my life to you"", I wouldn't really feel that he'd
listened - at least, I couldn't be sure that he had. So how does one (or
how did you) commit oneself to God?

2) In committing myself in this way, what do I have to forfeit of my
current life? What can I no longer do? I feel that I'm as 'good' as many
Christians, and I try to uphold the idea of 'loving your neighbour' - I
don't go round killing people, stealing, etc., and I try not to get
jealous of other people in any way - and I would say that I keep to the
standards of treating other people as well as many Christians. So what
do I have to give up?

3) When committed, what do I have to do? What does it involve? What (if
any) burdens am I taking on?

4) So then, what's the general difference before and after? I assume,
that (like on your birthday you don't suddenly feel a year older) it
won't suddenly change my life the day I commit myself. So what happens?

5) How can I be sure that it is the right thing to do? How can I find
out what the 'it' in the last sentence actually _is_?!

Thanks very much for all your help in answering these questions. Perhaps
e-mail would be a better way to reply, but it's up to you.

Geico has purchased radar guns in several states, I know they have done
it here in CT.

I have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by Geico
for years and then had 1 accident and were immediately dropped.  And once
you've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high
risk, and end up forking out 3 or 4 times what you should be for insurance.

My suggestion, stay where you are, or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico!

Okay, I got enough replies about the Kubota Kenai/Denali systems that I
will post a summary of their capabilities.  I haven't actually used one
or seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt.  I'd like to see
an independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme or
something.

Basically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that
run OSF/1 ( DEC's ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future.  They are
binary compatible with Digital's OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation.  Denali
is their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by
simply adding ""transformation engines"".

The two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation
and the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation.


			3400			3500

CPU			DEC Alpha AXP 133MHz	DEC Alpha AXP 150MHz

Other:				both machines will double buffer or do

Both have TurboChannel 100MB/sec, SCSI-2, Ethernet, and FDDI

APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES

Both have libraries for Xlib, Motif, MIT PEXlib, DEC-PEXlib DEC-PHIGS, and GL

Okay, now the real stuff.  The Kenai stations work with a graphics architecture
known as Denali.  The Denali comes in three models, the E, P, and V.  They
use a DECchip 21064 superscalar RISC processor at 150MHz.  Their
capabilities are as follows:

As you can see, these are pretty powerful workstations, and the best part
is the pricing.  I would recommend that you call Kubota for more information.
Their number is 408-727-8100.  I'm sure they'll send you an information you
may want.  Oh, some prices:

Low-end

Kenai 3400, E Series w/ 1 TEM and 5 FBM --- 27,795 dollars U.S.
Kenai 3500, E Series w/ 1 TEM and 5 FBM --- 45,345 dollars U.S.

High-end

Kenai 3400, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 61,795 dollars U.S.
Kenai 3500, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 79,345 dollars U.S.

If someone could post a relative comparision with an Indigo Extreme or
something I would appreciate it.

Hope this helps someone out there,

Brian

I was wondering if a group called 'sci.pharmacology' would be relevent.
This would be used for a more formal discussion about pharmacological

You are sure that what you call a 200SX we call a 240?  Just curious..
We also have a nissan predacessor (sp) to the 240 called a 200, which

Every so often, the Pope declares that some departed Christian is
now in Heaven, and may be invoked in the public rites of the Church.
It is my understanding that Roman Catholics believe that such
declarations by the Pope are infallible. I see three possibilities:
     1) The Church has received a Public Revelation since the death
of (for example) Joan of Arc.
     2) The Church was given a list before the death of St John
which had Joan's name on it.
     3) There is no public revelation about Joan, and Roman
Catholics are free to doubt that she died in a state of grace, or
even that she is a historical character.

What is wrong with ""the Spirit talking to Himself.""  Jesus intercedes
for us, and Romans 8:26-27 tell of how the Spirit intercedes for
us before God.  That is no theological problem.  Tounges as a prayer

Its true that this could be (and has been) used as a rug to sweep
any difficulties under.  But it is a valid point.  Paul does mention
angelic tounges in the verse.

If the languages we sepak are the result of Babel, then it stands to
reason that angels would speak a different language from us.  You do 
have a valid point about multiple angelic languages.  But angelic
beings maybe of different species so to speak.  maybe different species
communicate differently.

I have heard an eyewitness account, myself.  Such things are hard to prove.
They don't lend themselves to a laboratory thing very well.  I don';t
know if it is a very holy thing to take gifts into a laboratory anyway.

>Much as many faith healers have trouble proving their ""victories"" (since

That's an unprovable statement.  How can you prove if somethings been proved?
There is no way to know that you've seen all the evidence.  Once I 
saw an orthodontists records complete with photographs showing how one of
his patients severe underbite was cured by constant prayer.  

John G. Lakes once prayed for someone and saw them healed in a laboratory,
according to ""Adventures in God.""  Its an interesting book.

                      Washington, DC  20540

ROME REBORN:  THE VATICAN LIBRARY AND RENAISSANCE CULTURE
presents some 200 of the Vatican Library's most precious
manuscripts, books, and maps--many of which played a key role in
the humanist recovery of the classical heritage of Greece and
Rome.  The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican
Library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of
Rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the
Renaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson
Building of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 through
April 30, 1993.  The online exhibit will be available by
anonymous FTP indefinitely.

     The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The Vatican
Library, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine &
Biology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Came
to Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Each
section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit
directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and
separate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit
includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit,
but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if
there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items
omitted later in the planning process.

     This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance
scholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of
science or medicine, early music scholars, students of the
humanist movement, students of printing and the printed word,
theologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and
to librarians and information professionals.  Please get the
README file for details on what files this exhibit contains.  If
you have questions about how to use FTP, speak to your local
computer support person.  If you have questions or comments about
the CONTENT of the exhibit, please write to vatican@kell.loc.gov
while if you have any questions or comments on the SYSTEM please

Hello
	I have posted to this newsgroup once before and recieved a
moderately helpful response on a couple of issues. This I appreciated very
much . I would however like to know why it is that ther is simply NO 
information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics
programmer. The subjects are

	1) How do you access the extra video memory on a video board. I
know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to
dothis. I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books
and info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is a
way to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written in
assembly, which I don't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To get
any speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it?

	2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of what
the net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of
the advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that will
tell me in ""mostly plain"" english how the vesa calls work.

	My biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books,
I have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through both
gopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is
some lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot of
programmiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of telling
you how to really control the video bios. What are all the calls folks, I
know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. Where
are you, and why haven't you written a book yet? 

Please help

Thanks in advance

It was also the worst engine that Ford (Europe) have ever made - bloody
awful reputation. It's most successful application being the Transit
van.

Saab gave up with this motor and then made the Triumph 1854 (half a Stag V8) under license (I believe), but with 2-litre capacity and perhaps a different
arrangement for the cylinder head studs, before developing their own straight 
four from the Triumph.

excuse me, but what makes you think that just because he's atheist he
doesn't know anything about christianity????  in my (albeit limited)
experience atheists are often the ones who know _more_ about the
bible, having searched it from end to end for answers.  i myself am a
christian, but that doesn't mean i consider myself more of an
authority on my religion -- i just have a different perspective on it
(more biased in favor, naturally :) ).

it seems quite obvious why he is subscribed, if i may infer from what
he says: he is looking for an explanation.  who are we to question his
motives anyway -- at the very least (although i dislike this kind of
logic), one could hope that he will ""see the light"".  critcism will, i
fear, not give him a very positive picture of christians....

with regard to this, i guess i don't really feel sentiments of this
order can be proven -- faith has a lot to do with it.  this is why
those who search the bible from cover to cover for answers won't
necessarily get what they're looking for.  of course that doesn't help
anyone who doesn't already have faith -- what a big catch 22.  i
discovered this quite recently when i ran into an agnostic looking for an
explanation of my faith and i quickly discovered that i could give him
nothing more than my life story and a description of my nature.  faith
is a very personal thing -- any attempt to ""prove"" the ""facts"" behind
it must be questioned.

It sounds like she has a problem.  She has a problem opening up to her
husband so she is lesbian.  WHAT? In a marrige, a couple is supposed
to open up to each other.  Because she didn't feel comfortable opening
up to her husband she gets a divorce and comes to the conclusion that
she is lesbian.  Before anyone gets maried they should make sure that
they would feel comfortable ""open up the deepest part of her soul to
her husband"".  ""Sex, in her mind, is only a part of the whole
relationship.""  Did she think it was diffrent with a man. That might
be her problem.

Nntp-Posting-Host: ssc.sas.upenn.edu

My 85 Caprice Classic with 120K+ miles has finally reached
the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that
I am forced to post :).  Anyone out there who might be
able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below,
please e-mail or post!

1. When making turns, especially when accelerating,
   there is usually a loud ""thunk"" from the rear of
   of the car.  Sounds like it could be the differential.
   What could cause this?  Is the differential going
   bad?  I recently had the differential fluid changed,
   and it DID have tiny metal bits in it.  (And no,
   the sound is NOT something rolling around in the
   trunk!)  

2. On starting the car, I get blue (oil) smoke from
   the exhaust for 5-10 seconds.  Exhaust valves
   going bad?  Worn rings?  Anyone know whether the
   valves on the 4.3 TBI engine can be lapped?

3. Brakes.  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable
   with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is
   relatively clear.  Pedal does NOT slowly sink to
   the floor when held down.  Pedal does not feel
   spongey, but I suppose that bleeding the brakes
   might help -- could anything else cause this?

4. Tranny.  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting
   worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from
   3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more
   recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd.
   Fluid (checked with car running with tranny put
   through all the gears and then back to park, as per
   Haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark.

5. My springs all around are just about shot -- I have
   4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps
   in turns at moderate to high speed.  How hard are
   they to change?  Can they be reconditioned?

I'd be interested in hearing from any GM full-size RWD owners
out there with stories to tell and/or advice.  Here in Philly,
these cars are apparently stolen(!) quite often and converted
into taxis.  Apparently the cab conversion shops will get a
junk title for the car or switch VINs with a car about to be
junked.  About 60% of Philly cabs are Caprice's, with most of
the rest being Crown Vic's with a few old New Yorkers and
Impalas (& Broughams).

Turbo boost is necessary if a turboed car.
Fuel reserve warning.
Coolant level warning.

It would also be nice to have a gauge that would cycle across the different
sensors in the FI system such as O2 sensor, altitude, Air Flow...

I'd love to get Tranny and diff.
Brake temp would be great...

And a BIG ASS tach.  :)

Don't mind if I do.
As someone who would _love_ to see XV go to 24 bit, this
would be plenty for me.

    a) XV can Load a 24 bit image, and display it in all it's
24 bit glory on 24 bit X displays.
    b) All other operations (Crop, Dither, Smooth, etc.) are not
supported on 24 bit images.

how hard would this be?

Having recently purchased a 93 Probe with clear-coat paint, I 
would like to give it a good wax job.  What is the Best type of
wax to use for this type of finish?  Is paste or liquid better?
I would be waxing it by hand, and buffing it by hand, I guess
using cheesecloth to buff it (anything better you would suggest?).

I've heard comments here before about things like Turtle Wax
and Raindance not being very good, so I'm wondering what is
recommended for a quality finish.

Thanks in advance.

Funny, I thought the numbering scheme for both Lexus and Infiniti was
related to sticker price more than anything else, i.e. Infiniti G20 (around
20K), Q45 (around 45K), Lexus ES250 (RIP) (around 25K), Lexus ES300 (around
30K), etc.

Is there a conspiracy theory there?

 Speaking from experience, one doesn't need drugs to become disoriented
during hospital stays. I was in hosp for 5 days in late Jan; what with
general noise at all hours of night, staff coming every time I turned over,

I am writing this to find out the following:

1.)	Any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis.

2.)	The name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery.

3.)	Information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer.

My boyfriend, age 34 and otherwise in good health, was diagnosed with 
reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago.  At that time he 
saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta, 
Tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed.  
These treatments were not effective and because the damage was 
worsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was told 
there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissen 
wrap and a ""Hill Repair"".  He opted for the ""Hill Repair"". He recovered 
very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse 
and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva).

The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him 
that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition 
which he called ""Barrett's Syndrome"". If he can't avoid having reflux will 
he necessarily get cancer?

Basically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, I'd 
appreciate it.

I'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision
of newborn males on the population. Since your friend is not a man, she
can't imagine what it's like to have a penis, much less a foreskin. I
guess if American medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every
male, then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in
appearance...

The penile cancer thing has been *completely* debunked...she must be
going to school on a South Pacific island. Tell her to check the Journal
or Urology for circumcision articles. I remember at least 1 on an old
Jewish man (cut at birth) who developed penile cancer....I mean, if the
cancer risk was that great, the Europe who have been circumcising like
crazy, too. Teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue: a
little proper hygiene goes a long way - Americans are just too hung up on
the penis to consider cleaning it: that's just way too much like
mastubation. So you have surgical intervention that is basically
unnecessary.

Carrying in the glove box is not covered...I'm not sure what I was 
thinking there. It _is_ legal in Oklahoma. 

On inter-state travel, as long as it is legal for you to own
at your point of origination and destination, the gun is carried
in a locked compartment/box (glove box specifically excluded) separate
from the ammo, it is legal under Title 19, Chapter 44, Section 94(9? I
forget, and my copy of the regs is at home) of the US Code. This,
unfortunately, has not prevented the theft by state troopers of a
certain state (which shall remain nameless to protect the hopelessly
stupid) under that state's law.

	What we call today the ""Old Testament"" was being written up to approx-
imately 168 BCE, according to most modern scholars.  Aside from the book of
Daniel, the whole OT predates Alexander (the Great).  These books were written
(predominantly) in Hebrew.
	There were also other books being written at about this time and later
by Greek-speaking, or ""Hellenistic"", Jews.  These books are those which are
reckoned by many denominations as ""Apocrypha"".
	Before the closing of the Writings, the third part of what is today
called the canon, all of the books were in use by Jews of the day.  However,
there were those who reckoned (based on Zech. 13) that prophecy had ceased.
This faction maintained that there were no true prophets in their day.  They
also maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine
teachings from God.
	By the time of c.65 CE, another faction had entered the mess.  Christians
had come in claiming that THEIR writings were also suitable to be read in
synagogues and used for worship.  Therefore, the Palestinian Jewish leaders
got together and stated that the books written from the time of Ben Sira (Sirach)
onward were not sacred writings.  They justified this from Zech. 13.  In
particular, they said, the writings of the Christians (called heretics) were
not inspired.
	At about 90 CE, they codified things further by closing the canon in
somewhat of an official sense at the Council of Jamnia.  A few books (Ecclesi-
astes, Song of Songs, Esther) made it in after that date, but these were those
which had been written prior to the official cut off point (the time of Ben
Sira) for inclusion that they had established in order to keep out the Christian
and Hellenistic writings.
	Jerome excluded the 'apocrypha' because they were not in use by Jews
of his day and because they were (except for Sirach) not found in Hebrew in his
time.  His criterion for separating them from the other pre-Christian writings
was not based on 'inspiration'.

>people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?

Here is the short answer: because only
certain marriages are recorded in Heaven.

Now for the long answer:

In Doctrine and Covenants section 132, the 
chapter discussing eternal marriage (and, yes,
plural marriage), the distinction between
sealings under the priesthood and other 
marriages is revealed.  

When ""the children of this world marry, or are
given in marriage"" when they receive ""the 
resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are
given in marriage"" (Luke 20:34-35).
Jesus was simply teaching that marriages ""until
death do you part"" are not in force after death.

However, the Doctrine and Covenants continues 
describing eternal marriage.

D&C 132:19
   And again, verily I say unto you, if a 
man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and
by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is
sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise,
by him who is anointed this power and the keys 
of this priesthood; ... [ shortened for brevity AI]
and shall be of full force when they are out of
the world; and they shall pass by the angels, 
and the gods, which are set there, to their 
exhaltation and glory in all things, as hath been 
sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a 
fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever
and ever.

The Lord told Peter ""whatsoever thou shalt bind
on earth shall be bound in heaven"" (Matt 16:19).
Do you doubt that Peter was given the power to 
perform sealings?
Peter thought so because he taught that husbands
and wives were ""heirs *together* of the grace of
life"" (1 Peter 3:7).

""In order to obtain the highest"" (degree of
celestial glory), a man must enter into this
order of the priesthood"" (D&C 131:2).
When a man and wife are sealed they truly become 
""one flesh"" because their eternal ""increase"" 
(destinies) are enjoined completely.

Our Father has an eternal companion (and maybe
more because of the plural marriage conditions
of the law) who participated in our creation
and is equally concerned with our progress here.

There is no scriptural basis for this doctrine.
If fact, the only mention of our Mother is in
one verse of a hymn written early in the history
of the Church:

    O My Father

    I had learned to call thee Father,
    Through thy Spirit from on high,
    But, until the key of knowledge
    Was restored, I knew not why.
    In the heav'ns are parents single?
    No, the thought makes reason stare!
    Truth is reason; truth eternal
    Tells me I've a mother there.

Why don't we hear more about our Mother?

1.  Because our Father presides under Priesthood
authority (which is not a calling for Her);

2.  Because we don't all (necessarily) have the
same Mother it would be confusing for worship;

3.  Because our Father wishes to withhold Her
name and titles because of how some people
degrade sacred things.

I was simply observing that as a non-Jew, I am not in that community
which might be bound by such a decision (I don't know much about
the Council of Jamnia, but I have heard that it is not well-attested
historically). 'Faithless' has nothing to do with it, and I prefer

I wish the Dialogue_with_Trypho were a real transcript of a real
dialogue,, but I think it a fictional effect on Justin's part.
Putting that to one side, Justin's point may be evidential; one
would want to know- 'which books?'

Perhaps the reformers were traveling in all the light (MS evidence)
they had. Let's stick to the issues. Again, I prefer not to speculate
about motives. One would need quotes from Luther, Calvin, etc. to
evidence this 'preference'.

Is this the principle: 'Any (BC) text not quoted by Christ cannot
be counted as Scripture' ? Think well about this- Job, Ruth...?

I wrote:
 		These is a logically invalid *a priori*. 
 		Besides, we are talking about OT texts-

Dave W. answers:

Meaning what? Do you affirm the principle (that the D.c's can be
excluded since they contain 'false doctrine') or do you deny it? 
If affirmed (as is implied in your statement) how does one determine 
that doctrine X is false? Do you affirm every teaching in _Ecclesiastes_?

If so, it may be a test that cannot be applied. The Orthodox
faithfully believe that Psalm 151 is canonical. How can my
faith say 'Not!' ? All I hear here is the *a priori* I mentioned
before.

This is contrary to fact.

Can this be elevated to a principle? How is 'spiritual quality'

What can I say? You believe what you believe- I'm asking for
a consistency check. I don't see that the books were added- in any
construction this formulation begs the question. No one can validly
ask me to 'have faith' that these books are noncanonical.

i say extended warranties are a ripoff, high-profit item for dealers.
but what i really want to point out here is that you are not buying
5/60k, 6/75k, 6/100k.  you get 3yr/36k *free*.  so what you are buying is
2/24k, 3/39k, 3/64k.  keep that in mind when you look at the cost vs. coverage.
another point is that many car companies routinely fix car problems that are
out of warranty...why?  design/manufacturing defects that the company owns up
to, keeping customer happy, etc.

My wife wants to publish a newsletter. She's no artist, so she intends to
use comercial clipart and customise it a bit by drawing a circle or a box
around it etc. 
 
We have MSPublisher for manipulating text, but it is not suitable for doing
much with graphics, so she needs a more specialised tool. Right now she's
looking at Corel Draw and Harvard Draw. There seem to be more books in the
stores on Corel than on Harvard, so she's inclined to go with Corel on the
basis of popularity. Can anyone give us an informed opinion on which 
package would be more suitable or if there is an even better alternative
available? If this is a FAQ, please withhold the flames and just send the
location of the FAQ document. Thanks.

1) Is it ok to use clip art from Harvard Draw or whatever for commercial

Ron, you are absolutely right.  Not all kidney stones have calcium and not 
all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calcium-
oxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM article 
as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that 
conventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probably 
always will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance that 
you will be wrong.  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of 
damage, what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to 
sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?).

On the kidney stone problem.  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical 
chemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of 
calcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to 
measure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don't think that the 
serum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree).  If I can get a good 
nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue 
reserve for minerals, I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see 
how your technique compares with mine.

It is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision, but that he
interpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con-
sciousness, translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above
that of time and space into an immediate worldly context -- and getting it
wrong.  Not that he did it rationally, but rather that unconsciously the
perceptions became clothed in material images, instead of remaining in the
realm of the potential and not-yet-time-space-bound.  This difficulty of
translating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been
difficult, even for the prophets of old.  That is why their prophecies are
so often subject to multiple interpretations.  Likewise, the Apostles seemed
to feel that the return of the Lord was to be ""very soon"" in the sense of
perhaps the same generation. Yet the meaning of ""very soon"" has proven to
be different than they could grasp.  Prophetic vision tends to telescope
time, so that things that are far off appear to be very close.

Another possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to
happen, again in the realm of the potential-but-not-yet-manifest and which
was thwarted by other forces, including possibly an act of divine mercy.

There are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and
sincere and sober Christians (and others too).  It seems that great coming 
events are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these 
""apocalyptic"" times.  The various predictions (I'm talking about those that
appear to be sincere and sober) are hard to accept, yet hard to ignore com-
pletely.  One has the feeling ""something is about to start to get ready to 
begin to commence to happen"".  We are living, as the Chinese saying goes,
in interesting times.

As for how to discriminate, the Bible doesn't help much.  There is an Old
Testament passage (I forget where it is) that says you will know whether
a prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass.  That
helps eliminate the failures after the fact, but in the case of an earth-
quake it is small comfort.  It seems to me that all prophecies that give
specific times and places and events should be suspect, not in that they
are necessarily false, but in the sense stated above, that all such visions
are subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the
plane of earthly time and space.

For what it is worth, Rudolf Steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate 
could see into the future and predict coming events.  His answer was that 
it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti-
cipation in them, including proclaiming what he saw.  If this is in fact
a spiritual law, then the answer to your question about how to discriminate
is that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law,
knowingly or unknowingly, and as such his message should be considered
a priori to be dubious.  I.e. I would expect that those capable of making
true predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in 
the way that the prophet of the Oregon earthquake did.  However, I can
sympathize with the person who published the prophecy. Given the same
overwhelming experience that he apparently had,  I too might feel impelled, 
and even commissioned by God to tell my fellow human beings about what 
I had seen.

Last week I went to see a gastroenterologist. I had never met this
doctor before, and she did not know what I was there for. As soon as I
arrived, somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gown.
They told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for the
doctor. Is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the first
time? I don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), but
on the couple of occasions when I've gone to a new doctor, I met him
with my clothes on. First, he introduced himself, asked what I was there
for and took a history, all before I undressed.
 
Are patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctor
for the first time? Personally, I'd prefer to meet the doctor on
something remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish an
identity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. If
nothing else, it minimizes the time that I have to spend in the self
conscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a bare
bottom talking to somebody who is fully clothed.
 
Does anybody besides me regard this get-naked-first-and-then-we-can-talk
attitude as insensitive? Also, is it unusual?

   There is a engine warning signal on the dash board. While driving, this signal turns on, but not always. What does this mean? In the manual, they say ""Go to authorized mazda dealer."". It is really good idea. Don't you think so?

I think 21 months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable.  If

I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to
many newsgroups.

I wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.
This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images.

Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications
in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image,
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.

Never claimed it is a bug.
I tried kept sure I don't claim that JPEG is noting else than
a compression algorithm, because I know what the JPEG is.
(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many

: this verse indicates that she was without sin.  Also, as was observed at
: the very top of this post, Mary had to be free from sin in order to be the
: mother of Jesus, who was definitely without sin.

If the mother of Jesus had to be without sin in order to give
birth to God, then why didn't Mary's mother have to be without
sin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for Jesus?  For
that matter, why didn't Mary's grandmother have to be without sin
either?  Seems to me that with all the original sin flowing
through each person, the need for the last one (Mary) to have
none puts God in a box, where we say that He couldn't have
incarnated Himself through a normal human being.

My God is an all powerful God, Who can do whatever suits His
purpose.  This includes creating a solar system and planet earth
with the appearance of great age; providing a path through the
Red Sea for the children of Israel that does not depend on the
existence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the
right speed and direction; and the birth of Himself from a normal
sinful person without being tainted by her original sin.

I see far too much focus on the ""objects"" of religion and not
nearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to
all believers with the Author of our existence, without the
necessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits
to God in the form of Mary, Apostles and a Pope.

: Note that the idea of Mary being conceived without Original Sin, i.e. the
: Immaculate Conception, is distinct from the idea of Mary not having sinned
: during her lifetime, which is a separate doctrine and, I believe, also
: held by the Catholic Church.

If Mary was born without original sin, and didn't sin during her
lifetime, how is she any different from Jesus?  This means the
world has had two perfect humans:  one died to take away the sins
of the world;  the other gave birth to Him?  I would certainly
want to see some scriptural support for this before I would start
praying to anyone other than God.  Everything I have ever read
from the bible teaches me that Jesus was and is the only sinless
Lamb of God, not His mother, grandmother........

: Hope this is useful to you.

Very useful in helping me understand some of the RC beliefs.
Thank you.

I'm certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis

After a tip from Gary Crum (crum@fcom.cc.utah.edu) I got on the Phone
with ""Pontiac Systems"" or ""Pontaic Customer Service"" or whatever, and
inquired about a rumoured Production Hold on the Formula Firebird and
Trans Am.  BTW, Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me
nowhere.  After being routed to a ""Firebird Specialist"", I was able
to confirm that this is in fact the case.

At first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio.
She wouldn't go into any details, so I don't know if there were some
shipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they
simply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier.  As I say, she
was pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this,
feel free to respond.  Supposedly, this problem is now solved.

Second, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related
to the six-speed Manual transmission.  So as of this posting, there is
a production hold on these cars.  She claimed part of the delay was
not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore
having to wait for the right high quality parts...  I'm not positive
that this applies to the Camaro as well, but I'm guessing it would.

Can anyone else shed some light on this?

I look forward to reading it.  When I got to the library last week, it
was with the object in view to look at some articles that have appeared
over the last few years, since my previous look at the literature.  Un-
fortunately, they had moved the journal back-issues, so I didn't get a
look at the articles I was hoping to find.  I will continue to reserve
my own judgment on _arsenokoitai_ until I have seen the latest scholarly
work, and I can hope that REXLEX's posting may give some meat to chew on.

However, what I *can* do now, is to point out the methodological issues
-- what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter.
If the article REXLEX posts addresses these issues, so much the better;
if not, you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard.

	[it is only a minor point, but let me make it anyway; De Young has
	already contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that
	the ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and
	NOT with orientation.  I doubt this will have much bearing on the
	article as such, but thought I should point it out from the start.]

The hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a) coined the word and
b) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law.  The
questions I wish to raise are

	1.)  how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis?
and	2.)  what follows if one accepts (or stipulates, for the sake of the
	     discussion) that it is correct?

Note that b) is independent of a); I consider b) far more plausible than a),
which seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the
literature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word.  So far as I know,
Paul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters.  Unless
you have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages, it is *not* sound
methodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi-
ate text to ""fix"" the coinage's meaning for his audience.

As yet, the extract presents no evidence at all.  What do we need to confirm
or reject the hypothesis? (which, I should say at the outset, I find somewhat
plausible; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* way
of construing this problem passage.)  I'm going to set aside for the moment
the question of whether Paul might have coined this usage, to look at the
more tractable question of what it means.  For this there are, in principle,
two kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external.  That is,
we can look at the text of Paul's letter for clarification or look outside
that to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on, or to
derivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul's meaning.

The single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS no
internal evidence for Paul's meaning.  He uses the word totally without an
explanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list of
negatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning.

We are left, as the only ""internal"" clue, with the etymology or formation
of the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young (and others before
him) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing with
other men, where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex (""lie"" in
Leviticus, ""bed"" in Greek).  One problem is that ""bedders"" (_-koitai_) is
not, as far as I know, USED that way in Greek.  THEREFORE, I offer one
serious test which de Young's hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected:

	o  find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul (or not much
	   prior to his day) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies
	   ""men who have sex with X""  [obviously, the ""best case"" is to
	   find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.]

such texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way.
It is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under-
standable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtaposition
of the roots.  Existence of such parallels doesn't *prove* the hypothesis
correct -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether or
not original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse:n_) possible
of comprehension by his readers.

My ""test"" moves in the direction of external evidence.  If Paul does NOT
in his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect his
readers to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage)
or to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such that
they can guess his meaning without too much floundering.

External evidence, that is, texts other than Paul's own and lexicographic
or social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come into
the picture.  *If* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on Paul,
which *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss by
a contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu-
ality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* one
has grounds for

	o  denying that Paul coined the word
and	o  assuming that his readers might understand his meaning

Do you see the problem?  If Paul coined the word, then he REQUIRES his
readers to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage and
its intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating De Young's guess)
understand him to be referring to the Levitical ""universal"" prohibition
of male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where Paul has emphasized
at least to OTHER congregations (and so one assumes to the Corinthians --
how else to explain 1 Cor. 6:12, and the Corinthians having to be pulled
back from overinterpreting their freedom?) the NON applicability of Torah
law to his gentile converts!)

Among the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coined
the word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old Attic or
Ionic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would be
assimilated as _arre:n_.  To me, this implies that we are even more than
usually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage.  What
is Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation?

And if he *didn't* coin the word, but picked it up like the others in
his list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- for
his readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives no
other.)

I cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means by
this word.  We (and his original readers) are guessing.  They, at least,
had a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word and
explained it in great detail to them in person.  But we have no trace of
evidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy.

So -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word.
And it seems to be exceptionally meagre.  That is precisely the problem.
I can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about
the word:

	a)  it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe
	    very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activities

	b)  it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual
	    Greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their
	    part with the Leviticus passage)

	c)  Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an
	    association with Leviticus in his doing so.  He may or may not
	    intend the word to have an explicit and universal application
	    with absolute and clear boundaries.  [Since none of his OTHER
	    words in that list have such character, this last seems to me
	    about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses I'm advancing.]

Of these, I'd say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- but
I still have reservations about that, too.

If the word NEVER appears before Paul, and in later uses has some evidence
of depending on Paul, then one can opt for Paul's coining it.  If it does
appear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prior
use (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one should
normally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if they
can be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled.)  In
either of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account Paul's relation
to the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it be
from the Greek or Jewish communities, Paul's relations are hardly straight-
forward!

There is, so far as I have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aid
us in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis.  Your guess is as
good as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things).
But it remains -- so far -- guesswork.  And I don't know about you, but I
for one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God.  By all means
be convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as he
says elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat this
same character (Romans 14:22-23)

	""Hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and God -- and
	consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going
	against his conscience.  But anybody who eats in a state of doubt
	is condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act done
	in bad faith is a sin.""

For my part, I cannot see any way to resolve Paul's meaning in the use of
_arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and by
the nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certainty
of constraining Paul's own intent.  Paul, like Humpty Dumpty (and me, and
all the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices --
and sometimes leave his readers puzzled.  If that puzzlement leads you
to God, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of Paul's
words HAVE led some people), then Paul's intense communicative effort to
contrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences.
I have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if I
read him ""in the large"", if I can see him lay out his position in detail
and hammer it home time and time again.  I am much less certain about his
meaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.)

In my usual discursive way, I have gone on at great length about the first
of my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirm
that Paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same as
the Leviticus prohibition.  My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo-
thesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and
for later Christians.  Given my verbosity, this will be tomorrow night's
meditation :-)

I understand that Adobe is working on making Photoshop available for
the SGI Indigo, but that is just ""rumor"" and I wouldn't bet on it
until I see it. But they >are< going to release Illustrator for the SGI
""real soon now.""

              FDA Approves Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive
                      P92-31 Food and Drug Administration
              FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Susan Cruzan - (301) 443-3285


The Food and Drug Administration today announced the approval of Depo Provera, 
an injectable contraceptive drug. 

The drug, which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone 
progesterone, protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection. 
The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is 
released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy. It is more than 99 percent 
effective.

""This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent 
pregnancy,"" said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. ""As an injectable, 
given once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to 
missing a daily dose.""

Depo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and 
clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive 
protection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the 
injections.

As with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and 
risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional 
before making a decision to use it.

Depo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive 
studies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies 
in other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo 
Provera effective as an injectable contraceptive.

The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In 
addition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, 
dizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have 
acute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood 
clots in the legs, lungs or eyes.

The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the 
drug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug.

Recent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to 
osteoporosis. The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this 
potential effect.

Depo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for 
contraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich., 
which will market the drug under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive 
Injection, first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s. 
At that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause 
breast cancer. Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer, 
including breast cancer in humans, to be minimal if any.

       New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses
                      P92-37 Food and Drug Administration
                        Monica Revelle - (301) 443-4177

The Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new 
rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life-
threatening illnesses, such as AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. 

""These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious 
illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would 
otherwise be possible,"" said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. ""The effort 
to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and 
indeed a hallmark of this administration."" 

These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to 
approve a drug based on ""surrogate endpoints"" or markers. They apply when the 
drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such 
endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in 
themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified 
scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient. 

Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval 
earlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or 
prevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used. 

The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and 
effectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established. 
The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct 
postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate 
endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness. 

One new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a 
model of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the 
cause of AIDS. 

Accelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines that 
a drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used 
safely only under a restricted distribution plan. 

""The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process 
without sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight,"" said FDA 
commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. ""While drug approval will be accomplished 
faster, these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and 
effectiveness standards required by law.""

The new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if the 
postmarketing studies do not verify the drug's clinical benefit, if there is 
new evidence that the drug product is not shown to be safe and effective, or 
if other specified circumstances arise that necessitate expeditious withdrawal 
of the drug or biologic.

               Research Shows Promise for Preventing or Slowing
                       Blindness due to Retinal Disease

                   National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation

        Neutrophilic Factors Rescue Photoreceptor Cells in Animal Tests

     Baltimore, MD - Researchers at the University of California San Francisco 
and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that 
certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can 
prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The 
degeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of 
visual impairment 
     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of 
the National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose 
their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug 
treatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million 
Americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and 
100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease 
that causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo 
surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. 
     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) 
Foundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye 
Institute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas 
Yasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge 
Yancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an 
exclusive license for this research from UCSF.
     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to 
assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring 
substances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. 
Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their 
photoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light 
exposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic 
Factor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing 
unwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and 
Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. 
     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director of 
Clinical Research, said, ""BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that 
have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-
related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, 
and for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may

Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993

result frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF 
could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached 
surgically."" 
     ""Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the 
retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases 
to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope 
that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression 
and preserve useful vision throughout life,"" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., 
Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. 
     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in 
conjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for 
peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, 
motor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. By 
itself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease). 
     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a 
leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for 
the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve 
injuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and 
Steinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.

                 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease

                          Research Resources Reporter
                           written by Mary Weideman
                                 Nov/Dec 1992
                         National Institutes of Health


     High-fat, high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary 
heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have 
traditionally consumed diets low in fat.  These findings, according to 
investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have 
serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing 
countries. 
     ""This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and 
have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the 
importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body 
weight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing 
countries and affluent nations as well,"" explains principal investigator Dr. 
William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid 
metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. 
     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the 
food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while 
simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  
These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra 
Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have 
coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary 
heart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is 
virtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name 
Tarahumara means ""fleet of foot,"" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on 
""kickball"" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more 
while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.
     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, 
and pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, 
together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras 
also eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains 
approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 
percent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator 
in the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while 
low in cholesterol and fat.
     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values 
are in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated 
cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20
Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993

disease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the 
Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although 
able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-
cholesterol. 
     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria 
Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school 
building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food 
was weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the 
investigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food 
stipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, 
and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for 
cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements 
included participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  
Thirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were 
fed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an ""affluent"" diet. 
     ""In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 
percent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that 
many Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in 
fiber,"" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in 
the cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian 
Sonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  ""The CSI is a single number that 
incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in 
the diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol 
level, particularly the LDL,"" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet 
averages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor's ""affluent"" diet used in the study 
ranks a CSI of 149. 
     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of 
establishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before 
exposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating 
dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or 
plateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat 
and/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  ""You 
must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put 
into the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not 
discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease 
because the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on 
a plateau,"" Dr. Connor says. 
     After 5 weeks of consuming the ""affluent"" diet, the subjects' mean plasma 
cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL 
fraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, 
and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride 
levels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in 
weight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, 
yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 
days. 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21
Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993

     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized 
nations.  ""We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount 
of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic 
study.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary 
cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  
In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total 
calories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects 
the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary 
cholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased 
quite a bit in this study,"" Dr. Connor explains.
     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of 
coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of 
fat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because 
of their usual high fat intake. 
     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 
percent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI 
around 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in 
meat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent 
suggestions that Americans adopt a ""Mediterranean-style"" diet.  ""The original 
Mediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of 
fat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of 
meat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to 
olive oil is not going to help the situation."" 
     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the 
emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies 
undergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart 
disease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different 
diet than the average citizen.  ""If the pattern of afluence increases, the 
entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, 
which places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the 
developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can 
concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public 
health measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for 
unnecessary, expensive medical technology,"" Dr. Connors says.
     ""The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move 
their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a 
very short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary 
heart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years 
ago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,"" he concludes.

     needed to address the smoker's total environment and to
     reduce smoking prevalence significantly over the next
     decade.

Subject: Re: Dreams and out of body incidents
Lines: 26

Ever since I was a kid and learned to tell when I was in a 
dream I have used my dreams for fantasies or working out problems.
In my dreams I have done everything from yell at my mom
to machine-gunning zombies, not to mention myriad sexual
fantasies. I have deliberately done things that I would never
do in real life. I understand the need to control ones
thoughts, but I always felt that dreams were format free,
no morals, no ethics, no physical laws, (though sometimes I would 
have to wake myself up to go to the bathroom.)

Is this an incorrect attitude? Rather than weakening my inhibitions,
I could argue that I got certain things ""out of my system"" by 
experiencing them in dreams. By analyzing a dream I can determine
if I have a problem with a certain situation, i.e. in a dream
something will be exagerated that I can then contemplate and
see if it really bothers me or not.

I can't believe that other people don't do the same. It seems 
silly to attach moral significance to dreams.

I think that this is entirely different from out of body
experiences, which I have never had.

Contradictions welcome.

I hesitate to comment on the validity of this, because I do not know
what your friend meant by it. If he meant that whatever exists must
have been created, then he is open to the obvious retort that God
exists, and so God must have been created.

Perhaps your friend meant that we exist now but that there was a
time when we did not exist, and therefore something other than
ourselves must have brought us into existence. This seems plausible,
but an atheist might reply, ""So my parents engendered me. So what?""
Here your friend would have to explain why an infinite regress of
causes is not a satisfactory explanation. He would have some support
from philosophers who are not ordinarily considered religious (Ayn
Rand, and some others who are in the tradition of Aristotle). Having
argued for a First Cause, he would have to bridge the gap between
said entity and the God of Abraham. If he merely asserts that the
things we observe are ultimately dependent on things radically
unlike them, few physicists would disagree.

   The dogma of the Assumption does not state whether or not Mary died a
physical death before being taken into Heaven.  Catholics are free to
believe what they wish, whether it be that she was taken still alive, or
after having died.  I lean somewhat toward the latter myself.

Subject: Monthly LightWave mailing list FAQ
Lines: 130


----------------------   LightWave3D Mail-List   ----------------------

-- WHAT IS LightWave? --

LightWave3D is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a
device called the ""Toaster"" (from NewTek, Inc.) that operates on an
Amiga platform.  The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and
LightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional
photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes.

-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --

This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how
it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images
available to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and
LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the
package.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as
a group.

-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --

Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster
software, I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation
of the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving
specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.

You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!

-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --

To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail
message to the address:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain

Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this
point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated
script based system in place soon.  There shouldn't be too much of a
delay in joining.  Expect a ""welcome"" message within 5 days after you
send your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!

-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --

Contributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the
following address:

        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com

Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all
others joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so
you know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those
addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back
to you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no
longer valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This
doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list.  In fact, just the
opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it
couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad
address.

NOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.

-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --

Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address
you used to sign up:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain

I will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join
the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be
able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the
list!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send
a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend
forwarding of the articles to you.


-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --

I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the
originating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due
to lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a
compendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store
them in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an
index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that
relates.

If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI
hard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>

I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the
list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past
articles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to
the LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please
send a mail message to:

        fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com

The first command to the server must be ""HELP"" or ""USER name <passwd>"".

Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile.
Use USER name [passwd] to connect to the service.
Use ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.



-- NOW WHAT DO I DO? --

Well, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  If you have
something to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to
the list.  Every little bit helps.  Questions are welcomed!  It makes
some of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin>

If you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact
me at the address:

Cheers,

First off, if I'm not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fat,
not humans.

Secondly, your description sounds just like 2,4-dinitrophenol.  This is an
uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation.  Put in layman's
terms, it short-circuits the mitochondria, causing food energy to be
turned into heat.

2,4-DNP was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction.  In controlled
amounts, it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the
reduced amount of useful energy available.  It is very dangerous.
It would be wiser to adjust to your present body form, rather than
play around with 2,4-DNP.

But if you insist, I suggest you look up the literature in your own
university library.  You can obtain 2,4-DNP by taking a first year
organic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies (it's
a commonly-used reagent).

Interesting. What book got Moss the pulitzer nomination? None of the

Moss is People Against Cancer's Director of Communications. People

No doubt the sci.med* folks are getting out their flamethrowers.  I'm
rather certain that the information you got was not medical literature
in the accepted academic/scientific journals.  So, the righteous among
them will no doubt jump on that.

Also, insofar as it doesn't conform to the accepted medical presumption
that it just doesn't matter what you eat, and that we can think of the
GI tract as a black box in which nothing ever goes wrong (except for
maybe cancer and ulcers), the righteous will no doubt jump on that too.

Then there'll be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack, even
though he, like Linus Pauling, is lucid and robust well into his
nineties--but nevermind about that.  He shouldn't charge for his
equipment and supplies, since they're no doubt not approved by the
FDA.  Of course, with FDA approval an MD or pharmaceutical company can
charge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatments as
thalidomide.  But nevermind about that either.

Candida can do that to you. :-)  Gordon, I think that the best clinical 
trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal 
candida blooms L. Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the 
frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the 
candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus 
should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the 
intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to 
oxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the 
lay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I'm really 
amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.


The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all 
conventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if 
conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard 
medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials?
The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very 
important one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria 
after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason 
to dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply 
and safely(like it is in animal husbandry).

In Revelation 2-3, we see that in the first century church, there was one
congregation in each major city.  So there was one unified church.  Now in
each city, there were people of different cultures.  Naturally, they
formed something of a stew, with different members having different
heritages.  Nevertheless, they were ONE body.  They met together,
sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups
in places such as the temple courts.

Now in a particular city, then and now, you will find that there is a
common language associated with that region.  For instance, in Rome, Latin
was spoken.  In the United States today, English is spoken.  So it would
make sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common
language and not necessarily Latin.

Naturally, you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common
language.  In the first century church, there were probably many people
in the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the
message for people of foreign ethnic groups.  Today, however, you don't
see people speaking in tongues to translate sermons, even in so-called
Pentacostal churches.  We do have a modern day equivalent though --
bi-lingual speakers.  Now in the unified church of which I am a member -
sometimes called the International Churches of Christ, when we all meet
together on Sundays, there are headphones on people who don't speak
English from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their
native tongue.  Neat idea, huh?

Now, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays,
so sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish-
speaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in their
native language.  In addition, we meet in small groups a couple of times
during the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals.  So someone
who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also
speak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those
meetings.

As for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touch
with their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deep
friendships among their church relationships with people of many various
nationalities.  

>Has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action?

The action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead of
Latin?  Indeed not!  See my second paragraph in response to the second
clipping of your article.

However, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a
culture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted.

I'll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping.

>Rather I believe it has been enhanced, for Paul exhorts us to become as

You have met some needs of people, certainly, by helping them to be proud
of their cultural heritages when most denominations didn't.  Yet you have
largely isolated yourselves from having quality ""Christian"" friendships
outside your nationality (and your denomination).

We shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their
heritage.  However, we will do this in a way that does not destroy church
unity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples.

>This is the approach of some of the groups that you cite. 

It sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are going
about things in the wrong way.  And names like the African Methodist
Episcopal Church still make me cringe, although not as much as before.

I understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such
groups to be formed, but now we should try to unite.  I know that it's
hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one
body of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and I am working to
make it happen.  However, what might be a smaller step towards unity,
would be taking the word ""African"" out of your denomination's name.  Then
perhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the ""Methodist
Episcopal"" part also, and simply be part of ""the Church"".

There shall be one church, for the sake of unity, AND it shall be useful
in helping students new to America make the transition in culture,
language, and thought.  We shouldn't make a new denomination to try to
solve problems.  The whole denominational mindset only causes more
problems, sadly.

Thank you for the invitation.  That shows me that you indeed have the
heart to spread the gospel of Jesus as well as take part in your cultural
heritage.  Thank you also for responding to my post.  I know (all too well)
how they can be very time-consuming.

The whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions,
but I still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same
time.  My own church, the Boston church, has the acapella singing that you
mentioned in your post, yet doesn't limit expression of my Mexican
culture, even though I am in the MIT Campus ministry and not the Spanish
(speaking) Zone.  I have made a commitment to God that I will go to the
Sunday services of my church, because I know that my brothers and sisters
here are fully devoted in love for God as his disciples.

I don't believe in tongues, as you may have already picked up on, because
of my understanding of Biblical Christianity.  However, I am certainly
willing to visit your congregation provided that it doesn't interfere with
my normal worship.  Since you also live in Cambridge, I also extend an
invitation to you to visit our services as often as you like.  You can
meet the MIT students at the Student Center (across from 77 Mass. Ave.) at
9AM on Sundays to leave for worship or simply call me after Wednesday
night to find out where the service will be held on a particular day.
My number is 225-7598, but will be 354-1357 in a few weeks from now and
for the rest of the summer.  Our service normally last from 10AM to noon,
but occasionally are later or earlier (1-3 times per year).

The Bricklin was a car manufactured by a company started by Malcolm
Bricklin, who, I believe, was Canadian.  He was the first one to import
Subarus, and later was responsible for importing Yugos, I believe. 
Anyway, he had this idea that what would really sell would be a sports
car, but one incorporating a bunch of innovative safety features.  The
Bricklin was built to be that queerest of beasts, the safety sports car.
 If any of you remember the early 70s movement among car makers to
design ""experimental"" safety cars, you will recognize the general
appearance of the Bricklin - big 'ol bumpers, etc.  Anyone recall other
safety features?  The engine was an american v-8, Ford I think is right.

Personally, I kinda like the way they look, and if I remember from the
old magazine articles, the performance was only half-bad.  The choice of
colors, though, tended towards the 1970s lime green - yech - but highly
visible, I suppose.  

The Delorean, on the other hand, was a dog - nice looking (IMO) but no
motor at all.

  There is no data to show chromium is effective in promoting weight loss.  The
 few studies that have been done using chromium have been very flawed and inher
ently biased (the investigators were making money from marketing it).
  Theoretically it really doesnt make sense either. The claim is that chromium
will increase muscle mass and decrease fat.  Of course, chromium is also used t
o cure diabetes, high blood pressure and increase muscle mass in athletes(just
as well as anabolic steroids). Sounds like snake oil for the 1990's :-)
 On the other hand, it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet, and place

I think we do see an exception in the case of Cornelius and his
household, mentioned in Acts. Of course, they were baptised, but only
after ""God showed that He accepted them by giving them the Holy
Spirit"". This means they were already acceptable to God before their
baptism, and had they suddenly died they would have gone to heaven.

In case that seems far-fetched - an ancestor of mine was a missionary
who worked among the Hereros in Namibia. Some of the tribesmen were
jealous of Christianity, and they poisoned the first convert before he
could be baptised. Surely he still went to heaven? I'm inclined to
agree with a comment recorded at the time: ""It is not the neglect of
baptism, but its contempt, that condemns.""

A mileage chart should be available in the book.  It usually goes by
the class of car you own and year.  Usually you will end up adding a few
hundred dollars to the retail price or subtracting it...  Consumer
Reports also has a number you can call and get a quote for your area.
A friend of mine used it, and was quite happy with the service.  I
believe it cost about $10.00.

Protestants love to play up Jerome for all he is worth. They should
remeber that after the Decree of Pope St. Damsus I, Jerome did not
hesitate in accpeting the deuteroncanon, and quoted them as Scripture in
his later writings.  And as I have already pointed out, in a previous
letter on this subject, the Catholic Church has accepted the
deuterocanon from the beginning.  And the Protestants in the 1500's all
of a sudden revived the old theory of some, condemned by Pope, Council,
and Church, that the deuterocanon were not inspired.

Again, why must the Church of Jesus Christ adopt the canon of the
unbelieving Jews, drawn up in Jamnia in 90 AD, in countering the
Christian use of the Septuagint.                 ^^^^^

Usually, you apply

[G] =  [ 1  -0.34414   -0.71414 ][U]
[B]    [ 1    1.772     0       ][V]


after unlevelshifting U and V (subtracting 128 from them).

This matrix multiplication may give results out of RGB space, so you
have to clamp the resulting bytes to [0..255].
The conversion should be done with arbitrary big integers, not floats :)

This applies to YUV data whereas NTSC may have YIQ where a 33 degree
rotation to U/V is buid in.

One of the reasons I sold my '92 Civic VX was the chattery-grabby clutch
although I din't notice it being any worse in humid weather, perhaps because
its always humid around here.  I was told by Honda that it has to do with
changing from asbestos to non-asbestos linings, which began around 1990.
Someone could make some good money selling the old-fashion variety if it's
legal to manufacture them these days.  My feeling is that since many other
car makers do not have this problem, that it's a poor design or engineering
problem on the part of Honda.  Three things to look out for on all Honda
products - clutch chatter, bad brake rotors, and rusty exhaust systems.

You should remember that in Adam's transgression, all men and women
sinned, as Paul wrote.  All of humanity cooperativley reblled against
God in Adma's sin, thus, all are subject to it, and the sin is
transmitted from generation to generation.

We used to have a tax in Greece named after the Queen's Mother. The Queen

Subject: Where did the hacker ethic go?
Lines: 46

  A great many computer programmers read ""Dr. Dobb's Journal"".  In a recent
issue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  It
said:

  ""There's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer
industry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90's.""

  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the ""cracker"" ethic, which is something
entirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the
free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is
it that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to
have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person
like myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,
crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any
useful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely
ignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to
make truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves
hackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact
that the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so
for a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a
volume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller
than it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the
corporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the
286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  

  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of
innovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud
it; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative
systems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the
problem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for
blunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.

  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,
where?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves ""hackers""
allowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,
interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the
computer industry?

  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.

This thread si starting to get really silly. Such nonsense do not
belong in s.r.c and it really hurts me to read some of the posts on
this issue.

We chose to believe whetever we want, but we are not allowed to define
our own Christianity. we see in parts. If you see something that I do
not see, or vice versa, it does not give me the right to play jokes on
your belief!

There is no wonder that your ""miracle"" does not work. You designet it
yourself, and even if you were able to collect a group of people like
the one you describe, I see no reason why your ""miracle"" should really
happen. God is the one who does miracles, not humans!

After all we are all on the same way, or at least, we are all headed
for the same goal, following different paths. Remember that we are
going to spend eternity together. If I can not stand your view here on
earth, how can I possibly stand spending eternity together with you?

Tongues is a question of belief. Not wether you believe in Jesus, but
if you believe that He is able to give you this gift. Just as any
other of the gifts mentioned in the Bible. But there is no evidence in
the Bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way
better than others.

Maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more
interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying God, I don't know.
But if this is the case, it still does not suggest that the gifts are
faked.

In the Bible you will find that Jesus did not always do miracles. He
said that ""I do nothing, except what my father tells me."" Perhaps it
woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that
example!

In Him,
Bjorn

We were at a dealership today looking at buying a car and
the salesman was showing us something he was calling a
""buy back"".  Is that a car that was fleeted and then
given back for the new model the next year?  If that
is so, how many miles is a good number to have on it
and are these types of cars generally a good buy?

 I don't think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem.
 Unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight
 fluid.  Follow the manufacturer's recommended oil weight.  Some of the
 cars I have had (all standard transmissions 4 or 5 speeds) recommend
 changing the transmission fluid at 30,000 miles under normal driving
 conditions.  I've gone 100,000 without changing the transmission oil (and
 had to replace the transmission bearings!). My older cars used 85 weight
 oil whereas my 92 Honda uses 10-30 motor oil (or maybe 30 weight).

(Aaron Bryce Cardenas) writes:

   Romans 10:16-17 ""But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For
   Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faith
   comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word
   of Christ.""

   So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the
   gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids
   are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to
   respond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot
   be raised in baptism to a new life.

Catholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently, and that's
one primary reason why they baptize babies.  They believe that Baptism
produces a change in the soul of the baby, quite independently of any
volitional act on the part of the baby.  This change in the baby's
soul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have
without Baptism.  Since the infant does not have the use of his
intellect and will yet, these new faculties are dormant.  But as the
child gets older, the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play.

   Ezekiel 18:20 ""The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the
   guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The
   righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the
   wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.""

   If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty
   for anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.

Adam was given a number of gifts by God.  The chief among them was
what Catholics call ""sanctifying grace"".  (In the New Testament, the
word used for this is ""charity"".)  By his sin, Adam lost this grace.
He didn't lose it just for himself, however, he lost it for the whole
human race.  Because once he lost it, he couldn't pass it on to his
descendents.

That's why Catholics baptize babies.  Through his Original Sin, Adam
lost sanctifying grace for all his descendents.  Christ instituted
Baptism to give it back to everyone.

Babies are not being punished for anything they personally did; they
are simply lacking in something they need, in order to enter Heaven.

I was at an Adobe seminar/conference/propaganda forum/whatever-you-want-to-

going to be included in the next release of Sun's OS, (presumably Solaris.)
Sun was going to drop their development of Newsprint, and, in return for this,

Dr. Walter Martin personally selected Hank Hanegraaff to succeed him
as President of the Christian Research Institute -- the largest 
evangelical counter-cult organization in the world. In this skillful, 
careful treatment of an explosive subject, Hanegraaff documents and 
examines how the beliefs of the Word of Faith movement clearly 
compromises and confuse the essentials of the historic Christian 
faith. For the first time ever, this large and influential movement
is legitimately labeled as cultic.

In this book, Hanegraaff discusses such leaders of the Word of Faith 
movement as E.W. Kenyon and the Twelve Apostles of ""another gospel"" 
(Gal 1:6-9) (Kenneth E. Hagin, Kenneth Copeland, Benny Hinn, Frederick
K.C. Price, John Avanzini, Robert Tilton, Marilyn Hickey, Paul (David) 
Yonggi Cho, Charles Capps, Jerry Savelle, Morris Cerullo, and Paul and 
Jan Crouch).

The book is now available through Harvest House Publishers and should
be in most Christian Book Stores soon. You can order a hard-back copy 
through CRI for $14.99 by calling 1-800-443-9797 and avoid retail 
mark-ups.

The Christian Research Journal, which is a quarterly publication by CRI 
has an article in it's most recent issue just released called, ""What's 
Wrong With The Word Faith Movement?"" This is a good article that will 
inform you of each of the teachers above, and tide you over until your 
book arrives. If you are interested in receiving the Journal yourself, 
you can order it from CRI at the number above for $14 a year. It is the

The Civic does still come in a 4 door model.  My wife and I looked
quite seriously at the 626, Prizm (Corolla), and Civic, as well as
some other cars.  Our impressions: all three seemed well built and had
the features we wanted - these are similar to the features you want
except for cruise control, and we want a manual transmission and are
considering anti-lock brakes.  I also hate automatic seatbelts and we
both think having an airbag is a plus.  In general, comfort and
performance were both significant.

Some specific +'s and -'s are listed below.

Mazda 626
 + very comfortable and roomy
 + can theoretically get ABS on DX model, though in practice this is
   hard to find
 + base price for base model includes numerous little things like:
   tach, variable speed wipers, rear defroster, 60/40 split folding rear seat
 - more expensive than many other cars listed below

Honda Civic
 + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here
 + comfortable front seat
 + adjustable seat belt mounting
 - no ABS without EX model (includes $1000's of other things like a sunroof)

Geo Prizm/Toyota Corolla
 - seats not very comfortable to us (your mileage may vary)
 + adjustable seat belt mounting
 + can get ABS without lots of other extras

Saturn
 + SL2 was quite comfortable, though SL1 less so
 - motorized attack belts

Dodge Spirit
   no real outstanding +'s, but seemed generally ok
 - rear seat does not fold down

Chevy Corsica
 + comes with ABS standard
 - lower ""would you buy that car again"" and safety ratings in
   Consumer Reports (than first 3 cars above)
 - suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others (this would be a +
   for some)

The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the
626, and in our minds, not significantly better.

We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the ""big 3"",
due (a) to my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products,
(b) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate
of mine (c) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission, I find the
seat of the Tempo very uncomfortable, and the escort has attack belts
and no air bag.

We'll probably end up with a 626 - I saw a 626 DX with A/C and
cassette advertised for just under $12800 (Washington Post, April 14,
I think), and my local dealer says they can match that price.  I will
probably get the 626 (maybe tomorrow).  The main question in my mind
is whether or not I will have to do a ""factory order"" or ""preference
order"" to get one with ABS, and whether or not the dealership will
run the price up a lot if I do so.

I saw this a few years ago on ""Tomorrow's World"" (low-brow BBC
technology news program).  The patient is lowered into a bath of
de-ionized water and carefully positioned.  High intensity pressure
waves are generated by an electric spark in the water (you don't get
electrocuted because de-ionised water does not conduct).  These waves are
focused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone to
break up.  This is completely painless.

Of course, you then have to get these little bits of gravel through
the urethra.  Ouch!

Stephen, I suspect that when you and I use the word ""Hell,"" we have
different concepts in mind. When you encounter references to Heaven
in terms of crowns and harps and golden streets, I trust that you do
not suppose (or suspect Christians of supposing) that the golden
streets are to be taken literally, still less that they are what the
concept of Heaven is all about. Why then should you suppose that
about the ""fires"" of Hell?
     Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED? Do you remember the
last description of James Taggart, sitting on the floor beside the
Ferris Persuader? This comes close to a description of what is meant
by Hell in my circles. If the image of fire is often used in this
connection, there are two reasons that occur to me.
     The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell as
something that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as
any rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart --
but the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLAS
SHRUGGED, a smaller audience than those who have played with
matches).
     The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word ""Gehenna,""
one of the words translated ""Hell"" in the New Testament. It refers
to the valley of Hinnon, outside Jerusalem. In early days, it was a
place where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive)
to Molech. Later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where fires
burned continually, consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem.
""To be cast into Gehenna"" or ""to burn in Gehenna"" thus became a
metaphor for ""to be rejected or discarded as worthless.""

Lest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggart
is my own private fancy, I commend to you the book THE GREAT
DIVORCE, by C S Lewis. It discusses Heaven (no harps) and Hell (no
flames). It is shorter than ATLAS SHRUGGED, and available at most
bookstores and libraries.

 Yours,
 James Kiefer

Since the wheel/tire is balanced off the car i.e. the lugnuts are
not normally involved, how would they do that? I would think that
since the lugs are so close to the center of rotation any slight
difference in weight between a normal lugnut and a locking one would
not have any noticable effect on the balance. I could be wrong, it *is*

The disease you are talking about is toxoplasmosis.  It is a protozoan that 
lives and multiplies within cells.  In cats, the protozoan multiplies in the
intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces.  The protozoa can
cross the placenta to infect the fetus.  The disease may be asymptomatic
after the baby is born, or it may be very severe.  Toxo may cause blindness
and mental retardation.

Having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem; however, pregnant
women should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox.  In addition, whoever
does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his/her hands before handling
anything else, especially food.

   ""Questions arise as we begin to think about LOGOS and what His inner
consciousness was composed of. We need to clarify the two natures of Christ
briefly.  The divine nature, which has existed eternally, did not undertake any
essential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the
attributes of God, the foremost of these being His immutability.  This would
mean that it remained impassable, that is, incapable of suffering and death,
free from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation.  In the realm
of the divine nature it is better to say that the Son of God became that which
was not absolute-and in Himself.  The result of the incarnation was that the
divine LOGOS could be ignorant and weak, could be tempted and suffer and die,
not in His divine nature, but by the derivation of His possession of a human
nature.
     This would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the
human nature are properties of the person, and therefore ascribed to the
person. By this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent,
omniscient, and omnipresent, yet at the same time be also a man of limited
power, knowledge, a man of sorrows, subject to human wants and miseries.  There
is, however, no penetration of one nature into the other.  Deity can no more
share the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential
perfection of the Godhead.
     We are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the
possession of the double natures.  Christ's human nature is impersonal, in that
it attains self-consciousness and self-determination in the personality of the
God-man.  We must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the
Man. Nature is defined:

""the distinguishing qualities or properties of something; the fundamental
character, disposition or temperament of a living being, innate and
unchangeable.""

     Nature is then, in essence, the substance possessed in common, in as such
the Trinity have one nature.  There is also a common nature of mankind. 
Personality, on the other hand, is the separate subsistence of nature, with the
power of consciousness and will.  It is for this reason that the human nature
of Christ has not, nor ever had, a separate subsistence, that it is impersonal.
 LOGOS, the God-man, represents the principle of personality.  It is equally
important to see that self-consciousness and self-determination do not, as
such, belong to the nature.  It is for this reason that we can justifiably say
that Jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills, but rather one.  It is
theanthropic, an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the
human and the divine natures, being that neither the consciousness nor the will
are simply human or simply divine.""


[The quotation given above is not identified, and it's not entirely
clear to me what position Loren is taking on it.  Just for clarity,
let me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic
Christological heresies -- monothelitism.  That's the position that
Christ's two natures were not complete, in that there was only one
will.  In most cases (which I think includes this example), it was the
human will that was regarded as missing.

Normally people who talk about Christ's human nature as being
""impersonal"" mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense.  That is, they
are using ""person"" as hypostatis, not in the usual English sense of
personality.  In this use, the doctrine is called ""anhypostasia"".
Personally I think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of
denying that the Logos took on humanity fully.  However it has never
been formally ruled a heresy, and in fact has been held by influential
theologians both ancient and modern (e.g. Athanasius).  But the
quotation above appears to be going farther than even Athanasius went,
into the realm of the overtly heretical.

               (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper

               (4) Separately incinerate both groups.

               (5) Weigh the residue from each group.  [The residue of

          HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much 
          faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly).  
          
               Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro-

Let's review the Sodom and Gomorrah story briefly.  It states
clearly that the visitors were angels.  But ""all the men from every
part of the city of Sodom--both young and old--surrounded the
house.  They called to Lot, `Where are the *men* who came to 
you tonight?  Bring them out to us so that we can have sex 
with them.' "" 

For the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men
of Sodom and by Lot as *men*.  Furthermore we know from Gen 18:20,21
that the Lord had already found Sodom guilty of grievous sin--before
the angels visited the city.  It is clear that the grievous sin
of Sodom and Gomorrah involved homosexual sex.  It appears that
the men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had
group orgies in the public square--which simply indicates 
the extremity of their depravity.  It does not show that lesser 
degrees of homosexuality are not sinful, as Michael would have us
believe.

Ultimately our understanding of God's will for sexuality comes from
the creation story--not solely on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.  He
created us male and female, and instituted marriage as a relationship
between one male and one female, ""Therefore a man will leave his
father and mother, and be united with his wife, and they will become
one flesh.""  This marriage relationship is the only sexual
relationship which God blesses and sanctions. He regulates and
protects the marriage of man and woman, and even uses it as a picture
of the relationship between himself and his church.  But we find not
one word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between 
two men, or between two women.

Everything else that we find in the Bible about sexuality derives from
or expresses God's will in instituting and blessing marriage.  Thus
the Levitical code, which was given only to the Jews, forbade incest,
homosexuality, bestiality; the Ten Commandments forbade adultery and
the coveting of our neighbor's wife; other commandments forbade rape.
The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and
perverse (Jude 7) because they abandoned and/or polluted the marriage
relationship.  Thus also Paul regarded homosexuality as `unnatural',
Romans 1:26,27--not because this was simply Paul's opinion,
but because it was contrary to God's purpose in creating us
male and female.

Julie, it doesn't necessarily follow that you should use it (MSG or
something else for that matter) simply because you are not allergic
to it. For example you might not be allergic to (animal) fats, and
like their taste, yet it doesn't follow that you should be using them

reason enough not to use it. 

Altho' your example of the ulcer is funny, it isn't an

There is no comparison for handling, reliability, or overall quality of

There was an article in USA today a few months ago showing the results
of a study that actually only about 1% were homosexual.  I saw another
figure that listed 2% as the figure.  Of course, even if it were 99%
that would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior.
How many people have commited other acts of fornication?  How many
people have lied or sinned in other ways?

Why isn't it a specific feature of homosexuality?  Paul describes
""men with men working that which is unseemly"" to describe the acts.  
Sure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other
sins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins
sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of 
man's not glorifying God as God and being thankful.  Still, their
acts were shameless.

>homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the

>in passing.

Is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament?
Scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  Being ruled by the
Spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also
protects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is a
two edged sword that cuts both ways.  

I think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus.  
If the Law is reflection of God's character and true holy nature, then
those who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem.  
If homosexuality were ""natural"" (whatever that means) wholesome, 
endorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded
biggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of
it in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the other
sex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this
law was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that
this was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty
crime!  

Is every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look at
I Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a
law not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's
wife.  There is a prohibition against having your father's wife in 
Leviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besides
this one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting
adultery, etc.- he spoke against having one's father's wife.  

Notice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned
in the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan 
coustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of fact
taking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the Gentiles.  It was
just a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or
not.

One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument
is because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin can
be tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Is
homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin,
like lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of
the opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse.
God is greater than all of it. 

Another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural
power of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many 
people have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure there
may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed.
That is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not
God's willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program that
uses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God to
change them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other
sin.

I don't see how you come to that conclusion.  Paul's dealings with
pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order
to spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it
was just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols.
Paul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with
eating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty
to eat meat in order to spare others.  

But Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to
tough.  Paul wrote to ""make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts
thereof.""  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how we
should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.

Suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.  
Since others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul's approach
on pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should 
sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a
member of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual
""marriage"") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered 
a more damaging sin.

Yet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something
that God ordains, and Paul recognizes this.

Actually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell.
After he fell he would have to toil over the ground.

That is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious
position to be it.  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our
minds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just
like anyone else.

I'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this 
conclusion.  It's like saying, ""How should I kill myself, with gun or
aresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to
sleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat,
or all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts?
Would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them?  

In all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher
the chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with 
physical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all 
leads to spiritual death.

The issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the
actual act.  Second, isn't it historical snobbery to say that
only homosexuals of this century are capable of having ""loving
relationships?""  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual ""love.""
(btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.  Also,
where do you get that tax collectors are sinners.  That's certainly not
explicit.  Jesus didn't tell Zachias to quit his job.)

Link Hudson.


[I'm reluctant to comment in this in detail.  Our basic concepts of
the intention of Jesus and Paul are greatly different.  As I indicated
in the article, whatever the ambiguities of various words (and I still
think they are significant), it does seem clear that Paul considered
the homosexuality he saw around him wrong.  What you do with this fact
depends upon your basic approach to the Bible.  I'm afraid that
communication between legalist and anti-legalist Christians is even
harder than between Protestants and Catholics in the 16th Cent.  Since
you disagree with my starting point, obviously you're going to
disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions.
Sometimes discussion is still useful.  I've seen some very interesting
work on Paul done by Jews.  Obviously they don't agree with him, but
they sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant.  But I don't
see much sign for hope here.  In talk.religion.misc there's an axiom
that by the time Hitler's name is invoked, all hope for sensible
discussion is gone.  On this subject, when sleeping with goats is
invoked, I don't think there's enough basis for understanding to be
worth pursuing.  --clh]

Subject: Re: The doctrine of Original Sin
Organization: none
Lines: 42

Regarding the consequences of the original sin:

Catholics believe that what Adam primarily lost by his sin, for
himself and the human race, was sanctifying grace.  This is basically
a share in the Divine life.  Take a rock and make it able to talk:
what God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar.
It makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers
of any possible creature.  This is the ""everlasting life"" that the New
Testament speaks of.

What Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying
grace to the human race.  He instituted the Sacraments as the means by
which this life is given to people, and its increase fostered.

The absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion
from Heaven.  The nature of Heaven is such that it's impossible for a
human being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying
grace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and
attempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.  Neither
can human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace.

This all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since
both have souls.  Infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannot
enter into Heaven.  They too need this form of life in them, or they
cannot enter into Heaven.

Turning it around, infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the
Catholic belief in sanctifying grace.  Unless Baptism causes some
change in an infant's soul, there is no particular reason to insist on
the practice.  Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by the
Apostles themselves, and was *certainly* part of the Church shortly
thereafter.

There is evidence for infant Baptism in the New Testament itself: 1
Cor 1:16, Acts 16:15, 16:33, 18:8, also Acts 11:14.  It is known for
sure that at least one disciple of the Apostle John was baptized as an
infant: St. Polycarp (because of a remark he makes in the acts of his
martyrdom).  St. Justin Martyr mentions men and women baptized as
infants.  There is direct evidence in St.  Irenaeus's ""Against
Heresies"", and in Tertullian's ""On Baptism"".  All these so far
mentioned are in the first 170 years after our Lord's death.  After
that, there starts to be tons of evidence for the practice.

Ken,
Then what happens when you die?
Why are you here?
What is the purpose of Your life, do you think it's 
just by chance you're in the family you are in and have the
friends you have?
Why do you think your searching?  To fill the void that
exists in your life.  Who do you think can fill that void

 I am a little confused on all of the models of the 88-89 bonnevilles.
I have heard of the LE SE LSE SSE SSEI. Could someone tell me the
differences are far as features or performance. I am also curious to
know what the book value is for prefereably the 89 model. And how much
less than book value can you usually get them for. In other words how
much are they in demand this time of year. I have heard that the mid-spring
early summer is the best time to buy.

Hi!

We have an old Montage FR-1 35mm film recorder. When connected to a PC with
its processor card it can directly take HPGL, Targa and Lasergraphics Language
files. 24 bit Targa is quite OK for raster images, but conversion from 
whatever one happens to have can be quite slow. This Lasergraphics Language
seems to be (got the source file for one test image) a vector-based language
that can handle one million colors. It does some polygons too, and perhaps
something else ?

The question is, where can I find some information about this language ?
A FTP site, a book, a company address,.... ?

(OK, it would be nice to have a Windows driver for it, but I'm not THAT
optimistic...)

Thanks in advance for any help!

I don't agree, but I can only speak for myself.  I have a good friend
whose lifestyle is very sinful.  Do I hate the things she does to herself
and others?  Yes.  Do I hate her?  Absolutely not.  In fact, she tells me
repeatedly that I am the best friend she has in the world.  I care about
her very much despite the fact that I hate how she lives her life.

It's very easy to fall into the progression you describe above.  I've
felt it with my friend more than once.  There is a very important 
part of Christianity that you've overlooked above and makes it possible
to ""love the sin but hate the sinner.""  Before I look at someone
else's life and sin, I look to myself and am as disgusted by what I see
in *me* as I see in others, probably more.  Self-righteousness is
contradictory to Christianity and is what makes the progression you
describe happen.  If a Christian can truthfully quote Paul and say, ""Wretched
man that I am!"" [Romans 7:24 (NASB)], that Christian will be able
to love the sinner and hate the sin.  If we have the attitude of the Pharisee 
who said, ""I thank Thee that I am not like other men..."" [Luke 18:11 (NASB)],
we will hate both.

Looking in The Evolution of Anaesthesia by M.H. Armstrong Davison
(pub Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore 1965) I found the following
chronology:

""1853.  Charles-Gabriel Pravaz (1791-1853), inventor of the
galvanocautery, describes a glass syringe with tapered nozzle. This
syringe was intended to be used with a special trocar for injecting
ferric chloride into aneurysms, and thus to heal them by coagulation.

1853.  Alexander Wood (1817-84)  of Edinburgh invents the hypodermic
needle and adapts Pravaz's syringe for use with it.""

You might also be interested to read about the experiments of Sir
Christopher Wren in 1656, described by Oldenberg & Clarck in the
Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society in 1665. Using a
sharpened quill and a pig's bladder he injected opium, wine and beer
into the veins of dogs.

- If you have a hatchback, cover all your stuff with a white bedsheet to help
keep the stuff and your car cool, as well as *possibly* avoiding theft.

- McDonalds have good, clean bathrooms.

I purchased a used 1988 Nissan 300ZX (non-turbo) last year.  I had a 
question on gear/rpm ratios.  Right now in 5th @65mph I'm at 
2600-2700 rpms.  @70mph I'm at about 2900rpms.  Is this about the
norm?  I'm an auto neophyte so I'm just wondering if these are

Also, anyone know the top speed attainable (@redline???) for this model Z?

I'd suggest writing a detailed letter about the incident to the
hospital administrator. Specify the date and time. If possible the
names of the technicians. 

Send a copy to the clinician under whose care your friend was
admitted. I say this because, though your friend has no argument
with the doctor, I have found that administrators sometimes ignore
complaints until the patient becomes litigious. Clinicians may not
have been informed of the complaint and are very surprised to find
themselves named in a suit.

If there is no response within a week send a follow up letter.
Attach a photocopy of the original letter. Do this weekly until you
do get a response.

CAT scans are non-invasive but they can be very scary. The scanner
can be a bad place for the claustrophobic. There was an interesting
study in the BMJ, about 10 years ago, which found that around 10% of
people who had CAT scans found it so unpleasant that they would
never have another. This compares with 15% who said the same about a
lumbar puncture.

Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics 
that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few 
important parameters. 
The polygons are all convex. 
They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)

I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex
polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw
concave / self intersecting polygons. 
This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that 
simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.
Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.

The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small 
number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.

Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for
code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex
polygons.

It may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms.
If you limit yourself to 3 or four sided simple convex polygons
I think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a 
asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be.

Being a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic
persistent anything. Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical,
biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic
persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular
carcinoma.

Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of
a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be
determined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It
consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting
plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast
to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation, 
bridging necrosis, or fibrosis. 

CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and
CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed
out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have
it. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing
areas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe
it is a continuum. I don't know.

Before you finalize your file in the FAQs (or after), you might want to 
correct the typo in the following:

> Kinsey (see below) is the source 
> of the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by

It seems one or the other end of the rating scale should be identified with 
""homosexual"".

As a personal note, I guess I differ with you on the question of work 
entering human life as a result of sin.  
> Note that in the 
> creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.
 
Before the fall (Gen 2:15) ""And the LORD God took the man, and put him into 
the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."" which I would call ""work"".  
For me, the difference introduced by sin is the painful aspects of work added 
at the fall (I take the cursing of the ground in vs.17-19 to apply to the 
work for sustenance).  In a way, some view ""work"" as a blessing (Ecclesiastes 
is a fun book! - for melancholies).

I hope I do not sound caustic, maybe you can enlighten me further.

Well, this is certainly a delicate subject, and I guess you accomplished what 
you state as your purpose ""It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian 
homosexuality"", not for me the most noble goal, but you are writing a FAQ.

I wonder if you might temporize the apparent ""sentence"" of the specific 
homosexual you propose (arguably tenuously define).

  Perhaps that would be true of ""celibacy from homosexual relations"", or 
refrainng from their choice relationships, but that does not forbid 
heterosexual.  Could they not have/enjoy heterosexual relations ""for what it 
was worth""?
 
[This depends upon the person.  In some cases I think the answer is
no.  Even with those who could, consider what you're asking.  I assume
we're talking about marriage -- I certainly would not want to suggest
sex outside that.  You're talking about a permanent commitment to a
kind of sexual relationship that they aren't really sure they can live
with.  There may be people for whom this is a possible solution, but I
wonder whether it's entirely fair to the other partner.  I have a
cousin who was a victim of exactly this situation.  We found out later
(after her death) that her husband had had problems with his sexual
identity.  His family (conservative Christians) knew it, and pushed
him into getting married.  He continued having problems, and they were
near divorce.  She died in an accident whose circumstances some of the
relatives consider odd.  He has since had a sex change operation, and
has been moving around from state to state without being able to hold
a job, keeping their children in a kind of home life both sets of
grandparents consider irresponsible.  I hope you can understand why I
am not enthusiastic about pushing homosexuals into marriage.  I really
liked my cousin.  This is sort of an emotional issue for me.  Again,
it may be possible for some, but this is the sort of situation that
needs to be dealt with pastorally and not as a matter of fixed
ideology.  --clh]

I actually did better than when I had been tested 2 years ago....
Then putting 2 + 2 together, I realized that it all started back up
when the laser printer came into the office.  I kept track of the usage, and
on hi use days, I was worse.  I got better over the weekends....

The laser printer is gone, I'm 100% better!!!..... Whether it is the toner
dust or chemicals, I dont know (I am highly allergic to dust...), but
it definitely was the laser printer....

I define faith as ""belief, in the abscense(sp?) of evidence"". I also
include in ""evidence"" past experiences. Because I have no past experience
in a god actually having an effect on my life and because I have never
seen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the
neccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional
works I have read (And other reasons), I do not believe in any god(s).
From what I have seen, some people reconcile this lack of evidence by
using faith.
It is faith in that sense (the only way I _currently_ understand the word
""faith"") that I find intellectually dishonest.

>>The ambiguity of religious beliefs, an unwillingness to take

>
>I've heard this frequently - what exactly is Pascal's wager?

Pascal's wager goes something like this:
Premise #1: Either there is or there isn't a God.
Premise #2: If God exists, He wants us to believe and will damn us for not
believing.
Premise #3: If God does not exist, then belief in God doesn't matter
because death is death, anyway.
Conclusion: Belief in God is superior to non-belief because
non-belief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong, while belief in
God only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong.

Sound pretty straightforward and is logically sound. The problem is,
Premise #1 presupposes 1:1 odds between belief and non-belief. This is
flat out wrong, because of the sheer number of religions out there and the
fact that, for the most part, the religions are mutually exclusive. I have
heard theists referred to as ""99% atheists"" because they believe in their
god (or gods) to be the _one_ god (or set of gods). The consequence of
this is ""what if I pick the wrong god?"" Suddenly, the odds don't look so
good because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still
leaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another
god's version of hell.

I don't see how ""disillusionment"" enters into it. You see, I presented my
mother's treatment of me to show the cause of my questioning my atheism, a
questioning which continues to this day. I had already been an atheist for
five years before having any contact with my mother's version of
Christianity. If anything, I had become somewhat disillusioned with
atheism (uh, oh, I thought, What if there *is* a God?). Yes, in a way, I
have also become disillusioned by many religions, simply because I had
thought at one time that they had all the answers, if I only found the
right one.
I'm still looking, but each time I look in a different place, I become a
little stronger in my attitude (belief, if you will, no faith, though,
it's based on the evidence of past experience) that I'll never find a
religion which has all the answers.
Sorta like looking for Easter eggs. The more time it takes you to find the
next one, the more convinced you become that you may already have found
all the eggs you're going to find.
Someone else mentioned that critisism isn't going to make me think any
more highly of Christians. I have a contrary position: Constructive
critisism will likely improve my attitude towards Christians. Abusive
critisism will turn me off.
No accusations to you, Mr. Sapienza. I merely slipped that into this post

with the 2.2 i would short shift so that it would shut up..  the new

the axe, it is too late for them to do anything about this..

it is no mystery that the turbo mr2 is ""only"" 2 liters.. the engineers
had enough integrity to prevent any further abuses.  also, in europe
the MR2 Mk2 non-turbo was also ""only"" 2 liters.. as usual, the
undiscriminating american market (if it is japanese it *must* be good)
gets the dogs.. to be fair, we also got the turbo, which the europeans
did not.

wrong!  the GS300 and SC300 use straight sixes, while the ES300 uses a
V6.  only a giant like toyota can afford to have both a V6 and inline
6 in its lineup, but that won't last for long.

It's not scriptural, but comes from the patristic age, I think:
something about ""amare errantem, interficere errorem"", which sounds
more like ""love the errant, slay the error"".  No doubt someone else 
will know in particular who minted the phrase.  If I had to guess, I'd

>broken-ness.

I'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower
of Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In
fact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply
_couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the
troubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to
unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief
that resulted from frustration with God.

The first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through
most of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these
would cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to
continue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do
mean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between
me an atheism from time to time) would fail.

The second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and
the struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my 
life as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of
this is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor
have I ever been, ""on fire for Chirst,"" and I don't think I ever want to be.
Nevertheless, I am not ""lukewarm"" about my faith, so I don't really
fit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety
about my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of
internal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right,
but when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because
all the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a
destructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal
strife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no
responsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own.
Complete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a
very appealing illusion, especially when the so-called ""people of God"" are
behaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go
that route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.

IMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively-
hostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God
wasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and ""shut-up-and-do-what-
you're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and-
you're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet"" courtesy of some of Christ's
more overzealous followers.  

A final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a
very good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to
Christianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had
for one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world,
Christian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich
did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help
them.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were
thought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the
emporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost
Christ on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed
hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of 
their own moral view.

There are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time
to go into them right now.

I have been hearing bad thing about amalgam dental fillings.  Some say

ground for bacteria that will be resistant to antibiotics.   

My dentist wants to use an amalgam filling for me in a place where I have
two cavaties in one tooth and wants to use one filling to cover both.
He says that composite filling don't hold up well when they are large.
So, I would like to know if there are any other choices besides amalgam
and composite.  And, should I really even be worried about amalgam?  I
heard that some scandanavian country does not even use them any more- 
is this true.

Any information you can give me will be greatly appreciated.

Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8
bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This
colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these
modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped
to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a
32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. 
Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?

Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to
each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range
0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth
colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.

You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how
far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look
rather odd.

So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:

>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How
>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global
>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and
>>much more complicated.

>>If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much
>>more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially.

In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job.
Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.

As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If
that was not what you meant, then:

>(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many
>places so far.)

Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting
made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. Sorry
if I misunderstood.

>You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.

Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

Note:  the following article is submitted on behalf of someone (Frank 
daniels) who has difficulty posting to s.r.c, email replies to 
daniels@math.ufl.edu

	I am unable to post to the bitnet groups.
	Here is a capsule history of the Shepherding/Discipleship Movement in
the Churches of Christ (i.e. Crossroads/Boston):

	I could trace the Movement back as far as 1800, and indeed some of its
roots go back that far, but these were really ""influences"" on the Movement,
and not the actual movement, per se.
	I will start in c.1920.
	In that day, there were 'white' churches and 'colored' churches in
nearly every area (due to segregation).  Modern Pentecostalism was developing
as a predominantly 'colored' phenomenon.  Here, there was great fanaticism,
emphasis on emotional experiences, and belief in a personal guidance and
indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
	Many 'white' Protestant churches were growing into what became known
as conservative fundamentalism.  By the 1940s, the evangelical movement was
in full swing, and many groups were becoming part of it.
	When the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950's and 
1960's),
many 'white' church groups began to be influenced by the 'black' churches and
by what was going on there.  This spread started in the most liberal of groups
and spread to the more conservative ones by the late '60's.  In 1969, even the
Catholic Church was displaying evidence of influence by the other 
groups...still
evident today.

	The Churches of Christ are (and were) a very conservative Protestant
group.  When the influence from outside began to reach the CofC in c.1965, it
was generally not appreciated.  Conservative groups are very strongly 
resistant
to change, and the new movement was VERY different from the CofC status quo.
	The magazines put out at that time by CofC folks tell the story as it
unfolds.  New ideas came into the CofC.  There was a big push to reach out to
college students, young adults, and teens.  Some called this the Campus 
Evangel-
ism Movement.  Emotions, generally not highly regarded in the CofC at large,
played a more important role in the new movement.  In some places, people 
began
to speak in tongues (as their Pentecostal predecessors did).
	This was met with extreme criticism from within the Churches of 
Christ.
In some places, people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or 
for
advocating the ""Holy Spirit Movement"", another name for the new branch.  The
term ""Underground Church of Christ"" also came into use because these people 
had
to hide their differences (or they might be ostricised).
	There were several congregations, however, whose leaderships were
receptive to the new ideas (at least in part; the tongues-speaking never 
really
caught on).  One of these was the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville,
FL.  Campus Ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th Street, 
and
the new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism.  They also 
seemed
to put vitality into the church, which many felt had been lacking.
	In October of 1967, the 14th Street congregation hired Chuck Lucas to
be its Campus Minister.  By 1970, he would move to being the congregation's
(lead) Minister.  In the late 60's/early 70's, the congregation worked with 
many
other groups.  They held Bible discussions at Daytona Beach during Spring 
Break.
They organized talks in the fraternities on the University of Florida campus.
They also worked with UF sports people.
	In 1972, the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed.
When it was finished, the group moved and changed its name (now no longer
appropriate).  It became the Crossroads Church of Christ from then on, a name
that would become legendary.

	By this time, Crossroads was basically the only CofC whose programs
were fully aligned to the new movement.  While they didn't start it, they 
continued it and were responsible for where it wound up going.
	By 1975, none of the other Churches of Christ in the area felt that
they could cooperate with Crossroads, due to what they recognized as doctrinal
problems at Crossroads.
	Crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize, and later require 
attendance
at all church functions.  It was seen as a good thing for each member to have
at least one close relationship, a person with whom you would share all of
your problems, pray, and get help from.  The concept was called Prayer 
Partners,
which later became Discipleship Partners and also later became mandatory.  The
leadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while.
	The book called ""The Master Plan of Evangelism"" was a strong influence
on Chuck Lucas.  He (and the group) believed that it was every person's duty
and life purpose to carry out the great commission.  Crossroads was growing
in number, and numbers became VERY important (some would say all-important).
	A person who ""was evangelistic"" was ""spiritual"".  Evangelism meant
inviting people to Crossroads events; if you did this a lot and some of them
converted, then you were ""spiritual"".  There were sermons about how if you
bought groceries, the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to
services.  Everyone at your job ought to receive invitations.  Since these
people needed Jesus, you should be ""aggressive""--don't take 'no' for an
answer.
	If you did not evangelize enough, you came to be called ""lazy"" or
""unspiritual"".
	By the end of the decade, the Prayer Partner system was integrated 
into
a structure.  The Elders and Ministers were on top (like a big pyramid).  Then
the group leaders, Bible study leaders, and members.  Everyone who came in had
someone placed over them.
	It is at this time, 1978-1980, that the bad press about Crossroads
began to circulate.  The problem with rape on the University of Florida campus
was tremendous, but Crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate
problem.  There were many complaints about the congregation and its ""pushy""
evangelistic tactics.  Crossroads was considering the other Churches of Christ
to be ""dead"" churches, which aggravated them; it was aggressively recruiting
out of the other church groups (denominations), which aggravated THEM.

	By this time, Crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100)
where not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building, but
also they were sending out ""planting"" [create a new church] and 
""reconstructing""
[reorganize an existing church] teams to other cities.  By this time, the
Crossroads Movement was underway.
	A group was sent to the 30-member Lexington Church of Christ in 
Boston,
MA.  The team was headed up by Kip McKean, who had been converted out of a
fraternity by Crossroads (in Gainesville).  Kip held a still stronger view of
church authority, which he believed was heavily vested in the Evangelist(s),
and not so much in the Elders.  He had been fired in 1977 from the 
congregation
that he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong
with his theology, including the practice of what came to be called one-over-
one
Christianity.  [Called this by critics]
	In the first year, half of the 30 people felt that they did not want 
to
be a part of the new congregation.  They left.  But others began coming into
the new Boston Church of Christ.
	Ah, but I'm ahead of myself.
	At Crossroads, the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll on
the members.  Many have said that they felt that they were working hard, but
they were not achieving the results that were so important.  The numbers were
dropping.  From 1978, Crossroads membership declined steadily.  The leadership
began to tighten the reigns on the congregation, who was seen as being largely
""unproductive"" and ""unfruitful"".  The ""fruit"" passages in the NT were 
interpreted
as referring to new converts.  If you were not bearing fruit, said John 15, 
you
would be cast into the fire!  [Boston still teaches this.]
	If you love your neighbor, you'll save his soul (invite him to church
and convert him).  If you're not doing that, you don't love your neighbor.
And if you don't love, you're in danger of backsliding.  The logical arguments
continue in this vein.
	In 1985, Chuck Lucas was fired from his job as minister, due to 
recurring
sins in his life.  These struggles were never revealed to the congregation at
large, although many people outside the congregation had heard about them.  
For
by now, there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between most
Crossroads members and those outside.  [If you have contact, your focus should
be on converting them.  Bring them to a Bible Study.]
	Chuck's replacement was Joe Woods, who was fully supportive of the
Boston system.  As Boston grew in number, they began to offer 'training' 
sessions
for other ministers.  Joe went to Boston to be trained and returned to Cross-
roads ready to emphasize the ""total commitment"" to the church that Boston and
Kip McKean were now emphasizing.  Eventually, in Fall of 1987, the Elders at 
Crossroads (now 2 in number--Dick Whitehead and Bill Hogle) made a decision.
Boston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under
the direction of the church in Boston.  The Elders refused, citing their 
belief
that each church should be autonomous (something true in all non-Boston 
Churches
of Christ).  Perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here, since
Crossroads was no longer the 'example' to the rest of the Movement.  The group
now numbered about 800, while Boston was now larger (in membership).
	The Churches of Christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary
element of salvation.  At Crossroads, they taught what was called 'Lordship'
baptism:  you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be
baptized.  You had to 'count the cost'.  At Boston, they took this a step
further.  If at some time you became ""unproductive"", then your spirituality
was suspect.  People would begin to ask you if you REALLY understood what you
were getting into.  Anyone who said 'no' had their baptism deemed invalid:  
they
hadn't counted the cost properly.  They still had to be baptized.  Others 
called
this ""rebaptism"", and Crossroads didn't approve of this practice.
	When Crossroads announced that it would not follow Boston, many of its
members left Crossroads and went to Movement-related ministries, which were
now called Discipling Ministries.  You were either discipling (evangelizing) 
or
you were ""dead"".  They also used the nickname ""Movement of God"" for a while.
	By Summer of 1988, Crossroads was withdrawn from the Movement and now
stood alone.  They had few to no allies in the mainstream Churches of Christ,
and now none in the Movement.

	Boston, however, continued to chart its course in the direction that
they had been following.  They sent ""reconstruction teams"" to many cities, 
which
usually meant that they split the church there.  They stopped acknowledging 
other
churches of Christ as Christians and began to call themselves the ""remnant"".
The ""remnant"" of the Jews in the OT are those who are saved by God.  It was
felt that the ""remnant"" today represents all the Christians.  Sometimes they
would simply call their Movement ""the church"".
	They usually took the name of the city for their name, implying to the
other Churches of Christ that Boston did not recognize their existence.  Many
campuses have now formally forbidden Boston ministries from recruiting there
due to the number of complaints.  In some cases, it has been documented that
Boston ministries have lied to University officials in order to continue to 
have
access to the campus.  Any resistance that they experience is termed ""perse-
cution"", which all true Christians are expected to experience.  Are you really
a Christian if you're not being persecuted?
	The numbers at Boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989.  Since then, they have
fought to remain steady.  I have heard a tape of Kip McKean shouting at the
leaders for failing to fulfill the Great Commission (their life's purpose) as
God commanded them.  Their Christianity is highly centered on commands and
obedience.

	Crossroads once was called a cult.  Boston is now recognized by the
Cult Awareness Network and other national and international groups as a cult,
under a formal definition, because of the techniques which they employ.  The
term ""cult"" is usually differentiated from ""sect"" by the practice of those
techniques.  The techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being
techniques of destructive pursuasion, also used by other Shepherding
Discipleship groups.  [Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Thaler Singer, and many
others have written about the topic.]  These techniques include guilt 
motivation,
emotional manipulation, loaded language, the aura of sacred science (a sort
of mystic element seen in everyday events), and others.

	I have no particular axe to grind against the Movement.  I have numer-
ous friends who are still part of the Movement.  I have never had a 'falling
out' with anyone in the Movement.  I disagree with many things which they 
teach.
I recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system.
I hold no loyalty to the mainstream Churches of Christ and do not defend their
mistakes either.
	I want to point out, though, that unlike in many other systems which
are in other ways similar, the Leadership of the Boston Movement are as much
victims of the system as the members.  We do not have a leader who enjoys
manipulating his people.  The leaders believe what they teach, and they feel
accountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members.  When
members do not evangelize to their expectations, for example, the leaders feel
personally responsible as well.  The leaders are not out for money or power.
They want to evangelize the world in their lifetime.

	I have said too much, but there is much more to say.  There are many
examples I could give and quotes from other sources (including Boston 
bulletins)
that I could include.  But this is too long already.  You may post this if
you so desire.

This is a RFD on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a 
sharing on the ""Johannine hours"" as proposed each month by the monks of 
the ecumenical community of Taize (pronounced te-zay) in France.

NAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP: 
==========================

soc.religion.taize (Unmoderated)


PURPOSE OF THE GROUP: 
====================

The Taize Community is an international ecumenical community of monks 
based in France. Many young adults come there to search for meaning in 
their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a 
sharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a 
monthly ""Johannine Hour"" which will be posted at the beginning of each 
month. A ""Johannine hour"" involves a short commentary on a given Bible 
passage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that 
may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be 
posted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less 
in polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another 
to deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own 
life-journey.

The idea of ""Johannine hours"" was born in Taize as a simple response
to all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible's message in the
midst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is often
impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but
everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit
quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence,
we can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of
Christ.

During the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we 
understand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions, 
we find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to 
communicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening 
them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought 
us joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.

Perhaps those who read and think about the ""Johannine Hours"" in this
newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.

The important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the
personal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect
of sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.

BACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY:
=================================

The following provides some background information on the life and
vocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community.

""A PARABLE OF COMMUNION"": August 1940, with Europe in the grip of
World War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost
abandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bring
together a monastic community which would live out ""a parable of
community"", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of
the time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal
refugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation.

AN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize's founder spent the
first two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949,
seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and
celibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, each
one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.
Today, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestant
backgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them are
living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, North
and South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts for
themselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no
capital. The brothers earn their living and share with others
entirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, an
international Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live
in the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming
people in Taize.

TAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, and
less young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since
1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have
thus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinental
meetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the year
and they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any
one week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore
the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner
life and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to
6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers and
everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church
of Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too
small.

""A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH"" The community has never wanted to
create a ""movement"" around itself. Instead, people are called to
commit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood,
their city or village. To support them in this, Taize has created
what it calls ""a pilgrimage of trust on earth"". At the end of each
year, the pilgrimage has a ""European meeting"" which brings together
tens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for
several days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asia
and in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an open
letter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of the
poor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages
and provide themes for reflexion for the following year.

NOTE:  Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in 
       news.groups.

I've tried compiling it on several SPARCstations with gcc 2.22.  After
fixing up a few bugs (3 missing constant definitions plus a couple of
other things) I got it to compile & link, but after starting client
& server I just get a black window; sometimes the client core dumps,
sometimes the server, sometimes I get a broken pipe, sometimes it
just sits there doing nothing although I occassionally get the
cursor to become a cross-hair in dog-fight, but that's it.  I've
sent word to the author plus what I did to fix it last week, but
no reply as yet.

Or perhaps you write a freely available, GPLed unix for commonly
available computer platforms (i386/i486 machines) and become a catalyst
for a major netwide project which produces a better unix-like os than
many commercial counterparts (see comp.os.linux for details).  Or maybe
you found a Legue for Programming Freedom to fight restrictive litigation
and software patenting practices, thereby protecting the creative freedom
so vital to continuing progress in our field.  Or maybe you start up
a gnu project, and produce by far and away the best c/c++ compiler
for unix there is, not to mention other valuable utilities.

Some hackers make significant contributions without selling out their
ideals.  As for Bill Gates, after pawning of grossly inferior software
onto the PC market for ten years, if he ever was a hacker, he deserves
to have his name eradicated from the Annals of Computer Hackery.

As for me, I like running linux+X+countless other packages, without
paying a dime.  On the other hand, I have no problem purchasing motif
or other good software, as long as Microsoft hasn't fouled it with their
inept input.

My 2 cents worth, flames will be patiently ignored. :-)

Though you can certaily assert all this, I don't see why it necessarily
has to be the case. Why can't hate just stay as it is, and not beget more?
Who says we have to get disgusted and start hating the sinner. I admit
this happens, but I donlt think you can say it is always necessaily
so.

Why can we not hate with a perfect hatred?

Certainly we should love even our enemies. Amos 5:15 says to hate the evil
and love the good. This can't contradict Christ's teaching. I think we tie
up both hate and love with an emotional attitude, when it really should be
considered more objectively. Surely I don't fly into a rage at every sin
I see, but why can I not ""hate"" it?

On a more cheerful note, perhaps hackerism/hacking isn't completely dead.

As someone else said, take the GNU offerings for example - free, redistributable and 
often better than the commercial stuff.  Take also the number of papers published
every year in all the fields of computer science - the vast majority of these papers
detail original work of real, often exceptional merit - and the authors are sharing
this knowledge.

I agree that the Toyota is the best looking I just didn't fit plus it is the
highest cost of all the ones you mentioned. I have good friends who have all
three of the trucks you talked about, the ones with kids all went to the
ford because of the room required to carry a couple of kids and all the junk
you need. The single ones went for the Toyota and the Nissan. Every one has
been happy with what they bought. Although no one is into serious four wheel
off road driving.

Ok, what's more important to gay Christians?  Sex, or Christianity?
Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex
completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,
to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong,
etc?  If not, why not?  Heterosexuals abstain all the time.
(It would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders
to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life)

To tell the truth, gay churches remind me a lot of Henry the VIII
starting the Church of England in order to get a divorce (or is
this a myth).  Note that I am not denying that gay Christians are
Christian.

I will wimp out and admit that I never liked the metaphor of
Jesus ""paying"" for our sins in the sense that many Christians
accept as literal. The point is that God understands the suffering
we go through, not just intellectually like when we watch
the Somalians on TV, but _really_ understands, He can ""feel"" 
our pain. This fact is manifested by Jesus' life. We can argue
that someone in history might have suffered more than Jesus,
we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion, we can
think of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading to
worse despair, but the main point is that Jesus is in the
trenches with us, He is in everyone, whatever I do to the least
of humanity I do to Him, and whatever I do for the least of
humanity I do for Him.

Now, to reconcile this with the existence of hell is beyond my
capabilities, but that wasn't my goal.

I can do, hopefully that's all I have to do.

Does anyone know where I could get some source code for a GIF viewer on a PC.
It doesn't have to be fancy, it would be best if it were written in C to 
display gif pictures on a VGA screen.  I was hoping to get it for free
from an FTP site, but I haven't been able to find it yet.

----------


[1]  What is JPEG?

JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") is a standardized image compression mechanism.
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either
full-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes.
It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line
drawings.

JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it
handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG
respectively.

JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are
invisible to the eye.

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small
files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image
archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.


[2]  Why use JPEG?

There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store
24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a
2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the
size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even
with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using
JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply.

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel
(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have
only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as
black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed
in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.


[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?

JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,
GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.

As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or
gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and
similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display
hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,
such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels
that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.
(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they
should be avoided in JPEG files.)

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels
adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.
If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.

Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.
The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).

Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.
You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale
images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images
of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.

If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.
(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only
applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from
a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG
can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not
convert well.


[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?

Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three
files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section 6B.

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits
			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)
ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.
			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.
ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)

ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)
			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.
ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.
ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50
			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look
			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.
ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25
			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent
			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).
			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this.
ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)
			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:
			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the
GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical
ratio for real-world scenes.


[5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of the
information"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;
it's not a percentage of anything.

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.

The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for
experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to
go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.
The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).

If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are
prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".

(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other
JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different
quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just
""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)


[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.
If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"".
(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the
same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can
get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with
""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTP
List FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in
the news.answers archive.

NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.


[6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:

The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one
kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.

X Windows:

XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other
image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image
manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),
file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support
for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new
and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding
edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that
version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get
only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works
fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a
glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the ""save at normal size"" checkbox
when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,
also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The
ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped
displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software.

Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple
image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,
file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.
(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4
decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next
xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from
export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.


MS-DOS:

This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.
The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca
(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is
not flashy, but it's functional.

Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The
current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU
and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and
OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit
on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).
You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a
bit tricky; read the directions carefully!

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is
also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---
more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than
screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both
are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.
Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip
or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in
VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing.)

A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around
the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.
The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.

The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest
revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:
it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is
poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*
of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you
have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to
find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right
thing with hi-color displays.)

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20
and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or
jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.

Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in
particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format
files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version
2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.
NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is
not readable on non-PC platforms.

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI
formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.
A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs
is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20
runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document
refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means
""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA
mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files
in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you can
retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in
comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.

Microsoft Windows:

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.
(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,
due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)

The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0
is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.
Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...

JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG
files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's
an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.
(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,
including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)

WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;
it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.
It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and
slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror
sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow
286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,
which is roughly 25% faster.)

ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising
contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the
current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file
pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)

DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen
mode, not in a window.

OS/2:

The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).
Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip
    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.
/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip
    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip
    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.
    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip
    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows
    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip
    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing
    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed
    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.

Macintosh:

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of
the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.
To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running
System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install
the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.
(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0
in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is
not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for
details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.

The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big
improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu
(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and
QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people
like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out.

GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and
PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest
version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)
Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.

JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is
available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.
This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this
program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and
GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie
from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.
Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an
unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called
PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash
it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but
it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on
older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't
use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.

If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),
GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not
all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version
2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG
plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.

Amiga:

(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good
choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a
general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read
several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version
is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.

Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,
and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even
capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The
current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror
sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under
AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)

Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,
available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.

If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24
and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and
ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),
from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another
well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file
AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many
based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without
so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"",
""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,
anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space
it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.

Atari ST:

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.
These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.

For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level
grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.

I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for
Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.

Acorn Archimedes:

!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.

Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by
registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,
The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).

There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write
functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,
Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.


Portable software for almost any system:

If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.
If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a
display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM 24-bit image files.

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every
day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,
purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.


[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:

Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,
documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.
The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9
or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release
is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to
retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.
If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may
prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on
CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.
If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest
comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.
(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ
article ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)

The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and image
files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.
The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have
tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.

We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to
contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.


[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?

Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.
Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is something
of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck with
the standard usage though.)

Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most
images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings).

Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display
on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for
*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what
comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared""
into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image
source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.

(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see
posted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster
(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.
JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)

On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its
palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.
This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's
quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.
Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization
algorithm, you're out of luck.

For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in
this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent.

It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA
display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's
also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!

Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display
hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already
obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.
Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machine-independent fashion.


[8]  How does JPEG work?

The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine
transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more
than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.
This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files
/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in
using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.


[9]  What about lossless JPEG?

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the
final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG
algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.

Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say
""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.

At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees
bit-for-bit accuracy.

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a
Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.


[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?

Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;
it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations.

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of
official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's.

The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined
two JPEG-based file formats:
  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports
    pixels and not much else.
  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is
    a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation.
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards.

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the
TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well
defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common
denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped
inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are
available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor
that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand; see section 11 for details.

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and
Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This
applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF
format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format
files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)


[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:

1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,
    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.

2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a
    ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---
    it's worth a try, anyway.

3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they
    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.

4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off
    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.

5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are
    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),
    try stripping off everything before that.

In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	""begin"" line
	M_]C_X ...

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	""begin"" line
	M:'-I ...

If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading non-JFIF files.


[12]  What about arithmetic coding?

The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output
of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.
The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the
file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)

Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.
Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses
from these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best.)

At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future.  Stay tuned for further details.


[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?

It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could
decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered
image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around.

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an
identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current
free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation
output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)
One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.

In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original
quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.
(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.
If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but
that's a mighty limited capability!)

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format
(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot
of compression/decompression time this way :-).


[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?

As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original
full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from
that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality.

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to
make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;
that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in
section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)

Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through
JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,
not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color
border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows
system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this.)

cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but
for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher
Q setting may not be necessary.)

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.
If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The
trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency
color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).
To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression.
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image
than you'd get without smoothing.

With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing
capability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs.
Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed
dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular
fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong
smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing
wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol...

The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the
image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.

Well, you can just about set your watch by Honda releasing new models every
4 years and an upgrade half way through the cars life. The local acura
dealership tells me that the new Integra will be out very soon, i.e. May/June.

Its hard to find specific details as the Integra has been deleted from
most of the rest of the world - I have seen them in Canada and Australia
as well as the U.S. but it was discontinued after the first generation
in Europe. Normally you can see new Japanese models appear in Europe
or Japan first and extrapolate from there. C+D reported that the engine
would be a carryover I think.

I don't see how this logically follows.  True enough, Mary received a blessing
beyond any granted in all the history of humanity by being privileged to be 
the mother of the Savior.  It says nothing about Mary needing to be a ""blessed 
person"" _first_ in order that she might thereby be worthy to bear the Son of 
God.  Again, I think the problem is that as humans we can't comprehend how the 
sinless Incarnation could spring from sinful human flesh and God's Spirit.
Rather than simply accept the gracious miracle of God, we must needs try
to dope out a mechanism or rationale as to how this could be.  Mary's own
words, 

""...my spirit rejoices in God _my Savior_, for he has regarded the low
 estate of his handmaiden,...""

sound like the words of a human aware of her own humanity, in need of a 
Savior, similar to what David proclaimed in his psalms...not the words
of a holy being with no further need for God's grace.

I really apologize for harping on this, I don't suppose it's important.
It's just that I see Mary and Joseph and the Baby reduced to placid,
serene figurines I feel we lose the wonder in the fact that God chose
to come down to you and I, to be born of people like you and I, to share
our existence and redeem us from it's fallenness by his holy Incarnation.

A friend was recently admitted to North Carolina Memorial Hospital
because of suspected meningitis.  Serious business.  They wanted to do
a lumbar puncture, for which a CT scan is a prerequisite.

I arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned
from the CT.   She was in tears.  Evidently the technicians in the CT
lab had been very unpleasant to her.

To begin with, they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the
machine itself, and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the
machine, without any explanation.  Imagine this.  You worried you may
have a deadly disease, and next thing you know you're being put into
this big scary machine, without a word of explanation about what is
going to happen to you.  I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved her
hand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded with
annoyance and anger.  Next they inserted, or tried to insert, an IV
catheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained
of the pain.  The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare
without any words of explanation.

Is there anything I can do about these pigs ?

I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day
out.  And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative.
But this is simply no excuse.  Their purpose for existing is to help
sick people, and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior.
Fortunately my friend is fine.  But I imagine a large proportion of the
people who get CT scans are not fine at all.  They have cancer and that
sort of thing.  They don't need this kind of shit.

Also, since I named the hospital involved, I should also point out that
neither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassion
of any of the other personnel at NCMH.

The GL file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of

that tells the GRASP animation system how to display it.  GL stands
for Grasp Library.  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject
in the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ.

There are freely distributable viewers for GL files, and they are usually
named GRASPRT?.EXE (replace the ? with a version digit or letter).  Most
GL files contain frames that are hardware-specific to particular modes
of the CGA, EGA, or VGA adapters on PCs.  I think that there are some
copies of GRASPRT available by anonymous ftp (I know that I got one there
a long time ago).

A student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones, a

condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall, and she has been ill all
this time.  During her most recent doctor's appointment at her parents'

When she asked why so many x-rays were being made, she was told by a
technician that they need to see the area from different views, but she
says that about five x-rays were made from EACH angle.  She couldn't help
feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something.  She
is a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what was
happening if someone would have explained.  When nobody would, she got
worried.
	Also, she is told that thre are 300! surgery patients ahead of her
and that they cannot do surgery until August or so.  It is now April...
She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids.  But she has to go to
classes.  She wonders why they have given her no medicine.  She plans to
call back her doctor's office / clinic and try to get answers to these
questions.  But I told her I would also write in to sci.med and see what I
could find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seems
o.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this
or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care.  She does plan to

I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last
May.  It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes
the situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet
must buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed
manual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my
truck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts
rattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet 
says that the noise is ""a characteristic of the transmission.""

Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the
gear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about
55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,
the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should
point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a
detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They
dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for ""engine longevity""
reasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.
Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times 
so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being
shipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between
stabilizer and control arm fell off).

Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What
really bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt
to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for 
them to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new
Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never
buy another Chevrolet.

Well, I am placing a file at my ftp today that contains several
polygonal descriptions of a head, face, skull, vase, etc. The format

Hey all,


I'm looking at buying a new car, but I'm confused about the insurance
coverage.  This also applies to my existing car insurance policy.  Does
anyone understand what the ""Limited Tort Option"" means.  Will it lower
my rates if I opt to have it, or will it be more expensive if I opt
to have it?  What does it do for me (in layman's terms please)?  Is
it a good deal or should I ignore it?  I'm not the type to sue anyone
at a drop of the hat nor am I the type to report every little ding to
the insurance company as a vandalism claim.  Please help.



Thanks in advance.

i have no experience with State Farm, but i think it's important to
differentiate your experience from a typical ""accident.""

hail damage is clearly not the fault of the owner, and also tends to
be well publicized in the media, so it's to the ins. co.'s benefit
to respond promptly and helpfully.  damage like this doesn't imply
anything about the likelihood of future claims (unless you live in an
area that gets frequent damaging hail storms), so there's no reason
for them to stop covering you.
that's a lot different from at-fault accidents or theft-related claims,
which may be more indicative of claim patterns.

But after you have taken antihistamines for a few nights, doesn't it start
to have a paradoxical effect?  I used to take one every night for
allergies and couldn't figure out why I developed bad insomnia.  Finally
figured out it was the antihistamines.  I would fall asleep for a few

I am considering the purchse of a 1987 VW Jetta GLI with 87k miles on it.
I recently found out that there are two versions of the GLI -- 8v and 16v.
I know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same
name:  the 16v version has 20 more horsepower, 4 wheel discs, and a standard
sunroof. 
Oops, that's the difference between the GLI 16v and the regular GL !!
So in addition to the engine, what other differences exist between the
two models of the Jetta GLI ?
More importantly, how can I tell which version this one is ?  There are
no badges that said ""16v"" so I am inclined to think that is the 8v version.
Assuming this one (the one I looked at) is the 8v version, is there a valid
reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped GL which would cost less ?
(Of course I would love to get the 16v version, but money talks.)

Please EMail any responses.  Thank you.

(I presume you are quoting John 3:3-7.)

1.  My King James Bible says ""Except a man be born of water 
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God"" 
(John 3:5).  (Here ""man"" == ""adult"").
(However, this could be a quibble between translations.)

2.  We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing:
""Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again""
(John 3:7).  Here Jesus is clearly directing his remarks
to Nicodemus -- a ruler of the Jews (not a child).

3.  We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even 
introduce the concept of spiritual re-birth through
baptism if newborn babies weren't free from sin?

A IDLER

[Yup, in John 3:5 ""man"" is not in the original.  A better translation
is ""no one can enter..."", as in NRSV.  Of course in 3:7, Jesus is
addressing the person who came to him.  There are other places in the
NT where he deals with children.  They've been mentioned in other
postings.  --clh]

& just out of curiosity, how is this ""dog clutch"" any different from a synchro
& transmission.  What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little
& i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as ""dogs""
& and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized
& gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,
& that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?

Motorcycle transmissions don't have synchros.  The engagment dogs are very
corse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the
gears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back
and forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the
clutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If 
you try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into
the next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn't a neutral
between gears (obviously there is, but you can't select it with the
shifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  ""speed shifting""
(which is what I have always heard ""clutchless shifting"" called) works
pretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the
clutch-especially for the lower gears.

I think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the
engagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition of
syncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions
that are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse
and sometimes first).

 Marty, I personally wouldn't be so quick and take that NEJM article 
 on kidney stones as gospel. First of all, I would want to know who
 sponsored that study.
 I have seen too many ""nutrition"" bulletins over the years from
 local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on the
 bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us
 compliments of the Dairy Industries.
 There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive
 financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous 
 benefits of increasing one's calcium intake.

 Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved 
 in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The study
 didn't say that, it only claimed that ""most kidney stones are large-
 ly calcium.""
 Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact
 opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they
 are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time.
 
 Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still 
 the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention 
 of kidney stones.
 I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in
 one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney
 stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE
 in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium
 type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit
 from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!

Marhaba Nabil,

If we posit two minds in Christ, the mind of the logos and the mind of the
human Jesus, then we must admit two wills.  A mind is not a mind without a
will.  I know this has been dealt with in past Church prnouncements, but there
is a philosophical problem here that should examined.

T. V. Morris argued that the Incarnation can be seen like this:

      _____________		
     (Mind of Logos)
     (	 _______   )
     (	(	)  )	Here, the mind of Jesus is circumsribed by God the
     (	( Human	)  )	Son.  God the Son has complete access to the human
     (  ( Mind	)  )	mind but the human mind only has access to the mind
     (	(	)  )	of God the Son when the Son allows access.  This 
     (	(_______)  )	explains why Jesus said even he did not know the 
     (_____________)	time of the kingdom.	

The human will acted in accordance with the divine will according to free
human decision.  But if the human will would have decided differently than
what was intended the divine will would have interceded, but this was never
the case.

He employs some very interesting analogies to support the one person/two mind
theory.  The ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from
the field of psychology, and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream, seeing
yourself acting, knowing that is you, but also being omniscient.  

The one hypostasis would be the unity of the two minds.  Agreed.  But I am
still waiting for Morris and others to respond to the lingering problem of two
minds making two persons.  Christian analytic philosophers are breaking new
ground in explicating the rationality of Theism and the Incarnation.

From what I understand of my experience in looking up this word, and

word is rather clear.  Basically it literally means ""he who beds with a man""
or ""he who has sex with a man.""  The burden of proof is on the

Secaris is reasonably inexpensive ($6.00 Cdn for a tube), and is indeed an
over the counter medication. Why it does not appear to be available in the
US, I don't know. It's manufactured in Montreal.

It's a nasal lubricant, and is intended to help nosebleeds that result from
dry mucous membranes.

Subject: Schatzki Ring/ PVC's
Reply-To: ohandley@betsy.gsfc.nasa.gov
Organization: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center - Greenbelt, MD USA
Lines: 49

Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the
following two health problems:

First, I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having a
Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand it,
the hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally
have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki
ring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular,
if I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food,
food occasionally gets ""stuck"" before reaching my stomach. This results
in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction.
Fortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying,
and causes frequent discomfort.

My doctor wants to ""dilate"" the ring using the
following procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach
for any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing
some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know
if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so,
was it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on
safety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become
a common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding
procedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this,
especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation,
reaction to anesthesia).

The second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number
of ""extra"" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there
has been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24
hrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than this,
however-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist
indicated that such a number was ""normal"". It certainly doesn't
feel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of
extended ""runs"" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause
severe light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good
health (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or
caffeine, etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as ""normal"", but don't
want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number
of PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something
as simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lying
down for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly
be related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the
same time.

Thanks for any help/advice!

 A 68 Corvette but, I don't want to put Corvette seats in it.  The original
 seats are in exc. shape but they are uncomfortable as hell.  I'm going to
 store those and find a set to drive in.  I have all the Vette catalogs but
 I'm looking for a more generic type seat.  I can modify the brackets but 
 cushion height and overall width are a concern.  I've looked through some
 local boneyards without success.  I would just like to find a pair of

He made no allegations, and specifically gave the seller the benefit of the
doubt.  He simply made the net aware of the fact that many of these seats are
stolen, so watch out and ask questions when buying.  That's good advice to
follow when buying _anything_ from a third party, on the net or elsewhere.

Well, suppose your mother was a crack addict and crack user/abuser while
she was pregnant? Suppose your husband gave you some SDT (this recently
happened to a close friend of my wife and mine)?

OFTEN, the consequences of our sin are at least partially inflicted on
innocent people. Several times in the OT, this is pointed out, even
saying that descendants would suffer consequences for a person's sin
for several generations. Even today, we see multi-generational (to
coin a phrase) effects from alcoholism, child abuse, and spousal
abuse just to name three.

So, God's definition of fair and ours differ.

Some points of perspective:

Though the predisposition towards sinning is now inbred (see Webster's
first definition of inbred) thanks to Adam, it is arrogant and foolish
for any of us to think we would have done any different if we were in
their shoes. I know myself pretty well, and I'm just not that good. Take
God's word for it, neither are you. ""There is no one righteous...""

More important, when a person decides to be a disciple of Jesus, God
promises supernatural help in overcoming our physical self's sinful
tendency. We can, of course, choose to ignore this help. (Rom 7,8)

""...God made mankind upright, but men have gone in search of many
schemes."" -Eccl

It is actually simple in principle. Porous adsorbents like zeolite and
activated carbon can adsorb gases evaporated from the adsorbate (water
or methanol, etc.) giving the cooling effect.  Upon being heated, the 
gas-saturated adsorbent bed will give off the gases which are then to be
condensed.  This forms the adsorption refrigeration cycle.  The only problem
is that the COP is very low (0.2 -0.6).

My son is considering the purchase of a 71 MGB, which has been substantially
restored.  The odometer has rolled over, but we can't be sure of the actual
mileage.  The engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the
restoration, except for a new carb and a few hoses.  He plans to do vacuum and
compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine.  The body
and undercarriage have no visible rust, the interior is new, as are tires,
front brakes (not sure about the back), battery, bumpers and other misc parts.
The paint is checked in a few places, and scuffed here and there, allegedly by
a wind-blown car cover.  It seemed to handle OK, except for soft front shocks.
Questions:

Are there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out?

The brakes seem soft and rather ineffective; what should we expect in the way
of braking action?

It seemed to be ""doggy"" when accelerating from a stop.  What should we expect
it to do, given the 4-cylinder engine?

The top is in place, but will not reach a number of the snaps.  The weather
was cold.  Should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up, or is it forever
shrunk?

Is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted, or are they usually chromed?

Given this rather limited description, what would be a reasonable price?

Gee, this turned out to be a little long--sorry.  While my brother once owned
an XK120 Jag (what a car!) we're obviously not into sports cars.  Any help with
these questions, or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be

On the basis of these examples I would say that Joe Moore was only wrong
in claiming Augustine as a prime mover of the sin=sex view.  These quotes
clearly equate sexuality with defilement and incontinance, even within
the marriage relationship (else they would not apply to Mary after her marriage
to Joseph).

So Joe's assignment of the reasoning behind the concept of the perpetual
virginity of Mary does seem to be supported by these quotes.

Lida,
I can emphasize with your situation.  Both my wife and I suffered from 
bouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a 
rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and 
chemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through 
her six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When 
severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to 
use supplements to bring her out of it.  I had ""cured"" her PMS using 
supplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet 
in depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and 
she was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after 
by wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and 
one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another 
stressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with 
supplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. 
I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using 
B6, niacin, folate and B12 to ""cure"" depression.  I'm not going to do that 
because all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.

Lida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the 
problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use 
an approach which will ""fix"" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly 
what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be 
affected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these 
stressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was 
pretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is 
a nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your 
bodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C), 
you have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any 
nutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from 
being emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase 
your need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become 
very important.

Lida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit to 
try to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming 
from.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic 
Medical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because 
none was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I 
preach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by 
my students as sermons).  Here is what I cover:

Every three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature 
to find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this 
in the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down 
and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books 
that have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which 
I write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various 
copyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for 
educational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not 
send this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do).

I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition 
assessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need 
to make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the 
nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to 
be required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to 
design supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment 
Centers of America, which is a private for-profit organization with 
hospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a 
nutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin 
Clinic in California has a similiar lab setup.

For physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new 
Clinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I 
have been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown 
series book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more 
to residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition
textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it 
does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a 
patient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the 
Preface of this new text:

""So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, 
hematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge 
of nutrition as it related to their field of practice.""  

""Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United

Lida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find 
a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals
(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and 
who could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when 
women suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are 
occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A 
nutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned 
that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red 
cell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium 
reserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to 
try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are 
also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral 
analysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using 
certified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some 
pretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone 
who will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are 
using a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Act).  

A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown 
to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging 
and software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But 
there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not 
show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.
Until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the 
U.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional 
profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses 
diet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue 
to be the best approach to depression.

If you are referring to the terms ""effeminate"" and ""homosexuals"" in
the above passage, I agree that the accuracy of the translation has
been challenged.  However, I was simply commenting on the charge that
it is an ""incredibly perverse"" interpretation to read this as a
condemnation of homosexuality.  Such a charge seems to imply that no
reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul
intended to condemn homosexuality; however, I think I can see how a
reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse.
Therefore I do not believe it is ""incredibly perverse"" to read it in
this way.

Actually, I wasn't thinking of the church at all.  After all, a couple
doesn't have to be married by a minister.  A secular justice of the
peace could do the job, and the two people would be married.  My point
was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual
marriage, but where in the Bible would one get a Christian marriage
between two people of the same sex?  And if you do see a biblical
basis for same-sex marriages, how willing would gay Christians be to
""save themselves"" for such a marriage and to never have sexual
intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship?  Please
note that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be
willing to be so monogamous, I am genuinely interested in hearing
opinions on the subject.  I have heard comments from gays in the past
that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main
points of being homosexual, yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to
be Christian would advocate such a position.  So what is the gay view?

noiser the older the oil is (I'm only guessing).

Certainly. Reference follows. 

Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called
red/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major
dysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long
wavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and
also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.

The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it
can also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.
It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. 
Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.

On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer
graphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour
deficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this
point. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red
corner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31

Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly
different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental
setup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.

So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?

This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one
affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto
which all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on
the spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is
very similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.

*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or
duuteranopia:

1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram
2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point
3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line
4) This is the new chromaticity. 

The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour
defective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and
Applications 8(5) 28-40.

You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not
familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.

>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow

>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!

Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red
green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and
the chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or
obtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a
couple of weeks ago.

The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a
help here.)

A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you
have the monitor data.
B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'
using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)
C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above
D) find the intersection as in step 3
E) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A
F) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it
along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and
white) until it is displayable.

I would guess the high price of gas in Europe (compared to the US) has
always favoured 4-cylinder manuals.

small engines with autos are a real bore...

But why not turn the question around, why are automatics so common in
the US?

My guess is that when they tried to couple manuals to the torque-rich
V8's in the sixties the clutches turned out as real killers you had to 
use both feet to depress, and that this has just lived on.

And also, an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive.

   Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current 
   status of his research would be appreciated.

Burzynski's work is not too promising. None of his A-1 through A-5
antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against
experimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against
leukemia in mice, with the result that doses high enough to produce
toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth
of the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985)

Burzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1
and A-5 (something which he has not shown, A-10 has only been
extracted from A-2. He also hasn't shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually
distinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10
against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines
from tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell and
small-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervous
system, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibited
neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested.

It is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski's
theory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it to
PAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying
peptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for
antineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1
mixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a
chemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically
extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which are
habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects
of thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity, A-10
does not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce
teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy.

Many of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory, early
research, past and present support by others for his work have been
shown to be untrue.

That's the whole point, David.  As spirits separated from their bodies
and living in the spirit world, they cannot undergo the ordinance of
marriage, just as they cannot be baptized, since there is no physical
body to be baptized.  We perform these ordinances as proxies for them,
in their behalf.  Thanks for asking.  Brooks

In many of our cities, there are traffic signals every 100 feet (unsynchronised,
of course (well here in Ottawa anyway)) and the roads are so congested that 
shifting manually is a real pain in the left foot.  Also, most Canadians are
too stupid to learn how to shift manually (gee, I gotta co-ordinate my two
feet on the clutch, brake _and_ accelerator, and I gotta steer, shift _and_
operate the signals (optional) and radio with my two hands... duh... it 
can't be done).  Also, most North American made cars come with the automatic 
as standard equipment, so why bother with a manual when the car can shift 
for you for no addition money.

Yes, but no more than he is worth. :-).  Seriously: Jerome is merely
(and grandly) another Christian witness, to be taken for what he can
tell us.  He is one in the community of saints.  You seem to wish for
a greater polarization and dichotomy between Catholic and Protestant
thought than seems to me, from a historical perspective, to be valid.
To be sure, Rome rejects (some significant aspects of) Protestant
thought just as vehemently as Protestants reject (some significant
aspects of) Roman thought.  Other than some peoplw who apparently try
to embody the greatest extreme of this rejection, on either side, there
is not quite so vast a gulf fixed as casual observers seem to assume.

Ecumenical consultations between Rome and the Lutherans, as well as 
those between Rome and the Anglican communion (to which I belong) show
very nearly complete convergence on understanding the basic theological
issues -- the sticking points tend to be ecclesiology and church polity.
Thus, for example, as you go on to say:

>                                                        They should

Many of us do not regard a papal decretal as having any necessary (as
opposed to political) significance.  Sometimes it will, sometimes it
won't.  You misread me if you think that my communion, at least, ""throws
out"" the deuterocanonical books.  Nor do I think you should overstress
the sense in which the more Reformed may do so.

>Again, why must the Church of Jesus Christ adopt the canon of the
>unbelieving Jews, drawn up in Jamnia in 90 AD, in countering the
>Christian use of the Septuagint.                 ^^^^^

I seriously suggest you rethink what you are saying here.  It verges on,
and could be taken as, anti-Semitic in the worst sense.  The ""unbelieving""
Jews were, according to what I understand as a Christian, the chosen
people of God, and the recipients of His pre-Incarnational revelation.
I think they have some say in the matter.  The Javneh meeting should not
be over-interpreted.  A recent magisterial study titled _Mikra_ (I don't
have more citation information on hand, sorry) produced primarily from
the background of Christian (rather than specifically Jewish) scholarship
suggests strongly that the Javneh meeting mostly resolved a lingering
question, where in practice the canon had long been fixed on the basis
of the scrolls that were kept in the Temple, and thereby ""made the hands
unclean"" when used.  The list of ""sacred books"" that may be drawn up from
Josephus and other pre-Yavneh sources correspond (plus or minus one book,
if I rememeber the chapter correctly) to the current Jewish canon of Tanakh.

All of this is not to ""throw out"" the deuterocanonicals (what, by the way,
is YOUR position about the books the Greeks accept and Rome does not? :-))
-- just to observe that the issue is complex and simply binary judgment
does not do it justice.

I too dislike the phrase ""Hate the sin, love the sinner"".  Maybe the
definite article is also part of the problem, since it seems to give
us license to fixate on our brother's peculiar pecadillo which we have
managed to escape by a common grace of heredity, economic situation, or
culture.  Our outrage at evil is too often just a cheap shot.

That said, I don't think Scott has adequately explored the flip side
of this coin, namely the love of righteousness.  In the Beatitudes,
Jesus blessed those who hungered and thirsted for righteousness.  In
the New Testament, it is never enough just to behave well, one should
always actively desire and work for the cause of good.  In that sense,
it should be impossible to remain dispassionate about evil and its
victims, even when these are its accomplices as well.

Maybe ""mourn sin, love sinners"" catches the idea slightly better than
""hate"", but only slightly, since grief usually implies a passive
powerless position.  A balanced Christian response needs grief, love,
and carefully measured, constructive anger.  Jesus has all three.  The
European pietists during WWII whose response to Nazi atrocities was
devoid of anger do not fare well as role models, however much love or
grief they exemplified.

My sister is an actress in New York and a Christian.  A few years
back, Jack, her long-time professional friend and benefactor, died of
AIDS, impoverished by medical bills, estranged from his family, and
abandoned by most of his surviving friends.  Only my sister and
brother-in-law were there with him at the very end.  In her grief over
Jack's death, my sister found quite a few targets for anger: callous
bureaucracies, the rigid self-protective moralism of Jack's family,
the inertia in Christians' response to AIDS, and, yes, even Jack's own
lapse in morality that eventually cost him his life.  Jack himself
shared that last anger.  Brought up with strong Christian values, he
was contrite over his brief dalliance with promiscuous sex long before
his AIDS appeared.  (I imply no moral judgement here about Jack's
innate sexual orientation, n.b.)

Maybe the hardest job is making our anger constructive.

First off, I would consider the severity of the pain. I had stones

heavy duty doses of morphine and demerol and a two week stay in the
hospital. I was told that there was nothing that I could take that would
dissolve them. If the stones are passible, the best thing she could do
is drink LOTS of water, and hope that they pass, but every time they
move a little, the pain will be excrutiating. I was told by my doctor
at that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth. (Yes,
by a male doctor, so I'm sure some of you women will disagree). I'd
really like to know the truth in this, so maybe some of you women who
have had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in.

I think you are reading it wrong.  I say those who are not saved are not
saved on account of their own sins.  It is not because God did not give
them sufficient grace, for He does do so, in His desire that all men
might be saved.  However, as only some are saved - and those who are
saved are saved by the grace of God, ""not by works, lest any man should
boast"" - the others are damned because of their obstinacy in refusing to
heed the call of God.  They are damned by their own free will and
chosing, a choice forseen by God in His causing them to be not
predestined, but reprobated instead.

>so God uses grace like margarine: he only spreads it where it's needed
>and not where it isn't?  and so there are the saved and the not-saved,

Certainly God does not distribute grace evenly.  If He did, no one could
have their heart hardened (or rather, harden their heart, thus causing
God to withdraw His grace).  But, you are correct - the world is divided
into those who God knows to be saved, and those God knows to be on the
road to perdition.  THe key is that God knows it and we do not.  Thus,
no one can boast in complete assurance that they are one of the elect
and predestined.  But no one who is a Christian in good standin should
doubt their salvation either (that shows a lack of trust in God).

You must admit it is possible.  Anyway, why would you want something in
the hear and know, when you can recieve 100 fold in heaven?  Better to
lay up your treasure in heaven is what Jesus said.
This is not to condemn the rich, but simply to point out that those who
are rich are frequently very evil or immoral, so God must give them
their blessing know, as they have chosen.  Remeber, Jesus promised
tribulation in this world, and hatred of others because we are
Christians.  He did not promise heaven on earth.  He promised heaven.

>so sin is either punished now or later -- and not both?  what if it's
> sort of half-punished?  are there any grey areas in this doctrine?

Not really.  Unless you do penance here on earth, you will have to do it
in Purgatory, as Paul pointed out (1 Corinthians 3.15).  Those with
poorer works, though still done with good intentions, will only be saved
through fire (the damned will of course go into fire immeadiately, for
whatever good they did was not for God but for self (dead works)).  Of
course, the Church gives indulgences, has Confession, and Annointing of
the Sick to remove sin and the the vestiges of sin, so there is really
little excuse for ending up in Purgatory - it is a last hope for the
somewhat lazy and careless as I said above in referring to Paul.

And no comments were taken as flames.  You are one of the more polite
people I have talked to over the net.

It is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concave/multi outline
algorithm, but not tremendously faster.  I spent awhile implementing and
optimizing both flavors, and the convex turned out about 10% faster.  This is
all C (on HP PA-RISC the compiler got the inner loop [shooting the span] as
fast as possible, as far as I could tell).  For any sort of game the database
to render is known ahead of time, and can be made all convex.  Definitely the
way to go.

""There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries""

By Mike Royko
Tribune Media Services


     On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings 
is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.
     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called 
Families USA.
      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe 
that doctors make too much money.
     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for 
physicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be 
OK.
     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.
     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment 
and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign 
and are still simmering.
     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that 
earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority 
of Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who 
do are stealing it from them.
     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.  
Karl Marx lives.
     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such 
as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to 
become a physician?
     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should 
have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they 
should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much 
a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a 
doctor?
     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  ""How 
much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent 
grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order 
to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking 
courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and 
maintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years 
of  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth 
years in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and 
(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) 
put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, 
depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in 
debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 
hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or 
more until they retire or fall over?""
     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably 
more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and 
Clinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have 
called together to remake America's health care.
     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far 
more useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, 
social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is 
to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.
     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, 
many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the 
major cause of high medical costs.
     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  
Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for 
our longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in 
a McDonald's?
     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become 
a  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch 
cabbages.
     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or 
Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But 
instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, 
they might have been more honest if they had said:
     ""Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest 
problems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, 
you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you 
guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; 
getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the 
microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into 
the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot 
victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease 
while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.
     ""You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single 
biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is 
amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.
     ""In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at 
your blubbery bods all day.
     ""So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and 
start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-
greasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.""
     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, 
there is another solution: Don't use them.
     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those 
spine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands 
upon your head and declare you fit.
     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest 
pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit 
there, and pop in a couple of valves.
     You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that 
overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house 
than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and 
malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?
     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  
And if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on 
how to give it its shots.
     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much 
pollsters should earn?

In my opinion, the limited tort option is the best thing Casey has ever
done. Basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to sue
for pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met:
1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X is
some number like 50,000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number)

2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean, the OTHER driver
was drunk)

3. You get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically, you can appeal
to regain your right to sue, but there's almost no chance of this ever
happening).

You are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you can
still sue for medical costs, actual damages, etc. By agreeing to limited
tort, you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who
treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery. In
exchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates. I save
$150/year.

Unfortunately, the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse
people so much that only about 5% of Pennsylvanians go for limited tort.
I guess that's OK -- If more people opted for it, the insurance
companies would be pushing harder for repeal.

I guess I'm still not clear on what the term ""candida bloom"" means,
but certainly it is well known that thrush (superficial candidal
infections on mucous membranes) can occur after antibiotic use.
This has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome, the ""quack""
diagnosis that has been being discussed.

Lucky how?  Since a recent article (randomized controlled trial) of
oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis, I've mentioned to a 
number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they
could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily.  It turns out most would
rather just use anti-fungal creams when they get yeast infections.

>yogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as 
>Gordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast 
>infections should decline.

Again, this just isn't what the systemic yeast syndrome is about, and
has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed.
There is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the GI tract with
bacteria after antibiotic therapy don't seem to be very helpful in
reducing diarrhea, but I don't think anyone would view this as a
quack therapy.

Mark, this is the most reasonable post that I've seen in Sci. Med. on the 
topic of Colonic Flushing.  I'm in a profession that uses manipulation(a 
very refined form of massage) to treat various human diseases.  Proving 
that manipulation works has been extremely difficult(as the MD's delight in 
pointing out).  The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making better 
progress than the chiropractors in proving(scientifically) that their 
techingues work.  The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation 
to relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or 
better than drug treatment(using physiological measurements, and not just 
the woman's preception of improvement).  This study was hailed by the JAOA 
editors as the turning point in the profession's long struggle to prove 
itself to the medical community.

I'm currently trying to get the AOA(American Osteopathic Association) which 
has supported most of the Osteopathic research in the U.S. to also support 
nutrition education and research.  I've pointed out, in a grant proposal, 
that the founder of Osteopathic Medicine(A.T. Still) embraced both diet and 
manipulation to set himself apart from the MD's of his time who were pushing 
only drugs(Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs 
during his service in the Civil War).  He decided that there had to be a 
better way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being 
worse than the disease.  Through his many years of study of the human body, 
he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his 
students in the U.S's first Osteopathic Medical school.  We now have 17.
Still used manipulation to treat(and also diagnose) human disease but he 
used diet to prevent human disease.  I'm trying to get the Osteopathic 
Profession to return to it's roots and beat the MD's to the punch(so to 
speak).  Both DO's and MD's in current medical practice have very little 
understanding of how diet affects human health.  This has to change.

If you want parallels the best source is probably the book _Temple
and Cosmos_ by Hugh Nibley.  It is not light reading however.

As to why these early practices ""only parallel"" and do not exactly
duplicate the modern LDS ceremony, there are a couple of reasons:

1.  Quite likely we do not have the exact original from ancient
times.  This stuff was not commonly known but bits and pieces
undoubtedly spread.  (Much as bits and pieces of the modern ceremony
get known.)  What we have in the 40 day literature, the Egyptian
ceremonies, and certain Native American ceremonies is almost
certainly not exactly what Jesus taught.

2.  Certain aspects of the ceremony are normally modified to fit the
situation, much as the modern ceremony has been modified to fit the
audio-visual tools now available.

Here in Australia most cars are manual (privately owned anyway).  Why?
Not sure, I think it has something to do with the fact that our car industry
in the past was more closely aligned with Europe than the US in the past.
Now it's aligned with Asia.

                FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE

          The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24
          in Orlando, Florida.  The conference was organized by the Rensse-
          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-
          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-
          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was
          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS
          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-
          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and
          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS
          users  to  ""take  charge of your PHIGS"" by participating in PHIGS
          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS
          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,
          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  ""beyond
          PHIGS"".

          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following
          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,
          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented
          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS
          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and
          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed
          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The
          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-
          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools
          based on PHIGS.

          Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.

          PHIGS EVERYWHERE

          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated
          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to
          mainframes.

          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including
          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing
          and translucency.

          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-
          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add
          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like
          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.
          Radiosity support is also planned.

          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging
          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate
          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase
          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.

          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful
          ""2-call""  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-
          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.

          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on
          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-
          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-
          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS
          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS
          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data
          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS
          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described
          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions
          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-
          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available
          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or
          Starbase.

          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows
          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most
          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many
          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-
          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS
          or ARENA is available on request.

          ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-
          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most
          workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-
          porates PEX support.

          Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital
          Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the
          DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.
          DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with
          support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most
          GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as
          proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and

Finding a disk array that can do 180MB/sec. will be difficult. The fastest
ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy (IBM also sells these). They
can attach HiPPI at up to 144 MB/sec. (64 bit). For these kinds of data
rates you need more than SCSI for connections. Their latest model, the
RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB/sec. but I think this may be a
limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not
exceeded that speed since their older model was faster. They are also not
idle (must be working on newer products that might be faster) and are a
small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces. They
still marketed the older, faster model as of a few mongths ago.

You might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult
to keep the HiPPI bus fully working at all times - sustained throughput
might come close to maximum burst rate.

Interesting problem. Tell us more if you can?

 Gaining entry into heaven cannot be done without first being cleansed by 
 the blood of Jesus. 
 Sin cannot dwell in heaven.  It is against the natural laws of God. 
 Being converted to christianity means being baptized by the Holy Spirit. 
 You cannot get to heaven by good works only. 
 Because of the union with the holy spirit, the man's behavior will change. 
 If there is true union he will not desire to be homosexual.  Fornication 
 and homosexuality will leave your life if you are truly baptized by the

Organization: Panix Public Access Internet & Unix, NYC

Meta-exegesis: Conviction of Sin,  part II

Let me return to the question, stipulating that Paul meant his use of
_arseonkoitai_ to refer more or less exactly to the Levitical prohibition
of male-male sex.  In order to bring out the problems most clearly, I'll
also stipulate (what I think is far less plausible) that Paul coined the
term for this usage.  The question I want to turn to is what that would
mean for Paul's readers and for later Christians.  This should be shorter
than my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us
with some of the major divisions within Christ's body, and I am not trying
to open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that
separate any of us from our fellow Christians.  My own biases (loosely
characterizable as ""liberal"") will be evident, but I am not grinding an
axe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD
to reach ""closure"" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we
each, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ.

So; stipulating Paul's intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HIS
READERS UNDERSTAND this intent?  And following on that question, there is
a second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him?

Since Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st
Corinthians, there are two ""positive"" answers and one ""negative"" to this
question:

+	a.  Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has
	    conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem-
	    nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be
	    sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no
	    futher explanation.  [I should note that there is no evidence
	    in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)]

+	b.  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul,
	    what God means ""behind"" Paul's inspired word-choice.)

-	c.  We *don't* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre-
	    cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul,
	    in the same passage of the word  _pleonektai_ (""those who have
	    more"" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is ""obvious"" from
	    its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word!  The NEB
	    translates it as ""grabbers"") or even _methusoi_ (""drunkards""
	    -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult,
	    so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!)

The three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration
for the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards
tradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical
demand for evidence.  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses.

_ad_ a:	It is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the
	community of Christ's disciples and their successors, and that
	our NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition.
	But it's also the case that we know little or nothing about this
	tradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say that
	we have access to the tradition only after several generations of
	possibly confused transmission.  The scripture is itself our only
	documentation of the tradition in the critical era.

_ad_ b:	If we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in an
	attempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under-
	standing the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions of
	men nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit
	from blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze.  But
	the downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit
	as our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that
	takes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent
	understanding supposedly derived from the ""clear"" Word of God.

		[Note: classical Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican thought
		constrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even
		while reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture;
		the more bizarre forms of ""I will read Scripture my way""
		are primarily a fringe aspect of ""cultic"" Protestantism.]

	The main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no
	means for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel
	*is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredible
	conflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind
	""convinced"" that he is led by the Spirit.  No one can seriously
	urge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian
	against Christian.  To what purpose?

_ad_ c:	The critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can
	reach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open
	to all.  The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually
	possible. :-)

	[If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias;
	one complaint against critical methodology is that it ""dissolves""
	faith -- but surely a ""faith"" that cannot honestly face the evalu-
	ation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to
	address.]

Anyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between
""liberal"" and ""conservative"" positions, mostly on the basis of extreme
zealots of positions b and c.  A Catholic sense of authority and tradition
tends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that
despite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as
ultimately divisive as the Protestant world will.  And Anglicans will (I
predict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each position
its due, but no more than its due. 

Second question.  Suppose tradition tells us, and lots of ""spiritual""
Christians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible,
that Paul is refering to a flat, universal Levitical prohibition against
male-male sex.  What then?  Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi-
bility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer.  But it's precisely
where inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they're most dangerous.

We have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of
tradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them).
We have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning the
traditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question.  Jesus
and Peter and Paul do not so much ""throw out"" tradition as subject it to
radical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds:

     ""the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith""
							(Matthew 23:23)
and  ""On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law,
      and the Prophets, also.""
							(Matthew 22:40)

If there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in the
challenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation
to go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts
(vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus' reported
words and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination
to *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges
against are in fact open to challenge.

All traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men.  That God may
lead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual
instruction I will freely grant.  But tradition is inherently human, and
inherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt).  Nothing in it is
immune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy
and good faith.  Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from
love of God and love of neighbor.

I am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin.  That
the Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I am
too dense to learn).  That tradition *might* have value here.  But what I
*know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christians
appealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated
""sodomites"" as the ""cause"" of the earthquake, so that legislation was
passed making homosexual behavior a capital offense.  If that is in
accord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian.  That is human
tradition at its most hateful and vicious.  And I see nothing all that much
different in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick
to condemn but slow to understand.  If that is the leading of the Spirit,
then I want no part of it.  But what I have found in obedience to the Lord
is that I am, myself, TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians,
for the truth that lives in the Body of Christ.

And I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel
said to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church:

	""be careful how you deal with these people...  If this enterprise,
	this movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of
	its own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will not
	only be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves
	fighting against God.""
							[Acts 5:36...39] 

All I ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptures
with a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit, and to the past history of our
first Christian witnesses' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER
readings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and
rabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the
love of God and neighbor.  Then, study the evidence; learn the history of
Christians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to
judge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge.  And let the witness of
the Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those who
are NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards God's truth.

[There's a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position (a), as to
whether you're speaking of tradition in Paul's time or ours.  I think
there are two ways to use tradition.  One is to say that when Paul and
his readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words
in the context of that shared tradition.  That's what makes me think
that these arguments over words turn out to be silly.  We know that
Paul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex.
Everything else he says on sex is consistent with that background.
The tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with
that background.  Even if the words in the sin lists aren't the most
general terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there's
some evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of
evidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no
evidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of
homosexuality.

But when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, that's rather a
horse of a different color.  The Catholic position involves a
continuing church tradition.  Arguments specific to that tradition
might be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul's original
meaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpreted
him, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in
our time because of the universal judgement of the church between his
time and ours.  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition.
A radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent.
tradition to illuminate Paul's original meaning, but not use the
Catholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to
homosexuality should be.

Please note that God commanded Adam to work before the fall:

""The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work
 it and take care of it."" (Gen 2:15, NIV).  

Work was God's design from the beginning.

This is a point that seems to have been overlooked by many. The ending of a 
1600 year old schism seems to be in sight.

The theologians said that the differences between them were fundamentally 
ones or terminology, and that the Christological faith of both groups was 
the same.

Some parishes have concelebrated the Eucharist, and here in Southern Africa 
we are running a joint theological training course for Coptic and Byzantine 
Orthodox. 

There are still several things to be sorted out, however. As far as the 
Copts are concerned, there were three ecumenical councils, whily the 
Byzantine Orthodox acknowledge seven.

Let me say that the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ is
central to Christianity. If you personally believe that Jesus Christ
died for you, you are a part of the Christian body of believers.

We are all still human. We don't know it all, but homosexual or heterosexual,
we all strive to follow Jesus.  The world is dying and needs to hear about
Jesus Christ.

Are you working together with other Christians to spread the Gospel?

Forgive me, but just the other day I read on some newsgroup or other a

seem to locate the article, but I recall there was mention of some safe
limits.

I looked at a ""Balanced 100"" time release formulation from Walgreen's

this safe?!?.

Also what was the condition that B6 was theraputic for?

The belief that the churches of Egypt and Syria were (or are) monophysite is 
false, as is the belief that they often held that the Council of Chalcedon 
was Nestorian.

These misunderstandings were exacerbated by political factors, and thus led 
to schism - a schism that is on its way to being healed.

That is an assumption on your part.  Where is your proof that one always will
degenerate into hating the sinner, because he hates the sin.

I am reminded of the Civil Rights movement in America.  It is true that many
individuals hated the proponents of racism.  It is also true that many 
individuals hated segregation and discrimination with their whole heart and
never degenerated into hating the individuals who practiced it.  Dr. King's
message was this.  Love the individual, the loving of the individual would
transform him into a friend.  However, this did not take away his hatred for
segregation.  His hatred for injustice.

I would ask, ""Did John the Baptist practice love when he criticized the Jewish
Leaders of his day?""  Did Jesus Practice love when he threw the moneychangers
out of the temple?

We must have at least a distase for sin.  We must in order to fight it in 
ourselves.  Also we must be ready for the call from God to call sin by its
right name.  Jesus loved everyone, but he called sin by its right name.

It is true that love for others is to guide every step of our walk, but it is
also true that sometimes the love for God calls us to stand up for truth.

Chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver
biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months
after a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to have
persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. The degree of
elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times
normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal. 
As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease. 
Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at
least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of
a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with
CAH needs to be treated.

Why on _earth_ would there be any effect on women's health?  That's about

   You may not think that it is fair, but how many sins do you know of
that affect only the sinner?  Is it fair for us even to be able to get
into Heaven?  Do we have a _right_ to Heaven, even if we were to lead

But one of the most basic concepts of Christian morality is that we
all have defective appetites due to original sin.  Not just
homosexuals, but everybody.  Thus we are not entitled to indulge in
whatever behavior our bodies want us to.

I think we need to keep clear the distinction between homosexual
_behavior_ (which is wrong) and homosexual _orientation_ (which is not
a sin, merely a misfortune).

Not only the Sonett (correct spelling), but the 95 wagon and 96 sedan
used a 1500 cc or 1700 cc V-4 from Ford of Germany.  This particular
motor had a 60 degree vee angle, a balance shaft and siamesed exhaust
ports.  This motor was later stretched into the V-6 commonly seen in the
Capri.

The V-4 could make pretty reasonable power for its size.  But in the
Saab, it made too much torque for the transmission, which had been
designed for a 3-cylinder 2-stroke.

Claude, I've not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin A(
retinol) could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damage(usually caused by 
high sound levels, but also occassionally due to severe infection).  The 
types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells 
and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing 
process.  The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respond 
to vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don't 
know if they are still capable of responding in adults.  If they are 
capable of responding with new hair growth, this would be a very major 
breakthrough in hearing loss.  With all of the medical interest in vitamin 
A, it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using 
vitamin A to reverse hearing loss.  But with only a news announcement to go 
on(and this type of communication is notoriously bad), I can't comment on 
your question anymore than I already have.  If one study has been done, 
more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing 
loss if there really is one.

This is misleading, at best.  The question, really, has to do with the
status of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue
predates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the
""deuteroncanonicals"" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put
them after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the
Hebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he
reports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just
dictating his translation to an amanuensis.

That is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in
Western Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the
first steps in ""reducing"" these books from the status they had (and have)
among the Greeks.

Furthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers ""threw out"" these
books.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome
had already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should
not be based on citations from these ALONE.

I think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it
seems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as
part of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)
are confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems
to play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow
""more inspired"" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable
-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God's word to the Jews in
Greek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a
big boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current
""inerrancy"" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of
the Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If
we can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is
surely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of
course, Anglicans don't do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, it
would seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the
Hebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which
led to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative.

BTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of
translation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome,
above) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; two
of four have been published so far.

Assuming that the wax is causing hearing loss, congestion or popping
in the ears, you can try some cautious tepid water irrigation with a
bulb syringe, but it is awkward to do for oneself and may not work or

Reply-To: eliot@engr.washington.edu (eliot)

It's been a while since I've reviewed a car but today I paid a visit
to an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he
makes a not too sucessful living selling them.

Without further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4:


1) Servotronic steering:

[For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is the
name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and
used in Audis and BMWs.]

I have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past
couple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of
the Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd.  I am quite happy to
report now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I
suppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been
loaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that
I have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I'd be much
happier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no
longer consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is
ruined.

The steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I
suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that
some makes it through to the driver's hands.  So there is feel and
there is accuracy in the S4's steering.  But there is also room for
improvement.  I consider the S4's steering to be better than the
Japanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in
""feel"" and engineer it out completely.


2) Engine

Wheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did
not expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be
putting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific
punch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it
encourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so
supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only 2.2
liters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a
fashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm
redline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which
translates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A
chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s.
The technical achievement is breadthtaking.

Throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In
fact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts
are almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the ""overboost"" feature
than to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features
up to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like
lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the
right foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a
few moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go,
maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb
ft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to
develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite
a heavy car, one's body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado
VR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding
in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one
is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the
turbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very
refined but bland sounding 5 banger..

Yes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as
serene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite
up to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I'd say that
in terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of
harshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However,
lost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark
that made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined.
The 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under
full boost.  Subjectively, I'd rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more
musical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi's own V8 is also far more musical,
with a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can
match its grunt.

The only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is taking
off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra
inertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat
delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. 
Alternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price
to pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should
offer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in
extremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The
characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically,
in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the
slush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...


3) Chassis

I've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively
modest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..
which is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke
wheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge
whatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth
watering macho, yet subdued look. 

On rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body
style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as
road noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I
digress.  To use a cliche, the S4's body feels like it has been carved
out of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough
roads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers
do not cause excessive harshness and while the S4's ride quality will
never worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or
pony cars.

The servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to
be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was
able to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation. I
think a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires,
talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a
banked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I
went around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the
skin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and
completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the
limits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were
thrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely
uninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of
story.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those
reviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX's clinical
efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.

The brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty
well too, though I've read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too
surprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi
100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more
wooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the
luxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by
additional braking capacity.  The LS400's fade performance is nothing to
brag about; neither is the Q45's or the Legend's.  Brake fade these days
seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused on
anti-lock capability.


4) Comfort

For a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also
excellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel
inserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 S4.  All the expected
gizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this
and that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed
because Audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the
car has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how
much the turbo dominates its performance.  

Unusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as
well as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.

Noise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn't
consider the Lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enough
to sway a potential buyer.


5) Conclusion

Even though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price
of $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to
offer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if
it doesn't produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan maker
offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is
worth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also 
top notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant 
automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 series
Audis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets my
thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being
all out exciting and intoxicating.

I can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues, 
however, a couple of them seem as though they do not require ""incredibly 
perverse interpretations"" in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality.

""... Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, 
nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, 
nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom  of God.  And such were 
some of you...""  I Cor. 6:9-11.

Would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say
fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God?  How does this apply
to homosexuals?  I understand ""fornication"" to be sex outside of
marriage.  Is this an accurate definition?  Is there any such thing as
same-sex marriage in the Bible?  My understanding has always been that
the New Testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband
and his wife.  I am, however, willing to listen to Scriptural evidence
to the contrary.

""You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an
abomination.  Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to
be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate
with it; it is a perversion.""  Lev. 18:22-23.

I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.  I know
of no New Testament passages that clearly condemn, or even mention,
intercourse with animals.  Do those who argue for the legitimacy of
homosexual intercourse believe that the Bible condemns bestiality as a
perversion, and if so, why?  That is, what verses would you cite to
prove that bestiality was perverted and sinful?  Could the verses you
cite be refuted by interpreting them differently?  Can one be a
Christian zoophile?

By the way, I myself am subject to sexual desires that I did not
choose to have and that many people would regard as perverted and
sinful, so please understand that I am not asking these questions out
of an antipathy towards my fellow ""people of alternative
orientations"".  I do believe, however, that one should read the Bible
with an attitude of ""what is the Bible trying to say"" and not ""what do
I WANT the Bible to say.""  I choose not to give in to my ""perverted""
sexual desires because I believe the Bible tries to tell me, whether I
like it or not, that such things are sin.  It is frustrating at times,
and I have had days where it really got me down, but I don't blame God
for this, I blame the sin itself.

- Mark

[There's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage
you quote.  Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that
""homosexual"" is not the general term for homosexuals, but is likely to
have a meaning like homosexual prostitute.  That doesn't meant that I
think all the Biblical evidence vanishes, but the nature of the
evidence is such that you can't just quote one verse and solve things.

I think your argument from fornication is circular.  Why is
homosexuality wrong?  Because it's fornication.  Why is it
fornication?  Because they're not married.  Why aren't they married?
Because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony.  Why does the
church refuse to do a marriage ceremony?  Because homosexuality is
wrong.  In order to break the circle there's got to be some other
reason to think homosexuality is wrong.

: -- 

I see your point, but I cannot more strongly disagree.

To repent means to turn around.  We, as a nation, have behaved incredibly
arrogantly toward God condoning, encouraging, and even forcing folks to
participate in activity directly opposed to the written Word of God.  We
have arrogantly set our nation far above the God who created it and allowed
us the luxury of living in this land.  We have set a bad example for other
nations.  We've slaughtered unborn children by the millions.  We have
stricken the name of God from the classroom.  We've cheated God out of the
honor due Him at every turn, and we owe God an apology every bit as public
as our sins have been.

When Jesus said ""Judge not that ye be not judged"", he was not addressing
those like John the Baptist who had repented and were calling others to
repent.  He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down
condemnation on others for their sins.  His message to us all was to remove
the log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother's.  But
He also said to rebuke and to reprove.  Don't forget that this is a command
too.

Our problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were
rebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with the
excuse that we don't want to judge anyone.

In truth, what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more
and to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives.  Call sin
what it is and do so openly.  Let it's charge fall correctly where it should.
But instead of running someone into hell over it, pull them out of their
hellward path and onto the heavenward path.

The April 1993 edition of MIX Magazine carries a story on 3DO which

indication from the people at 3DO as to where they intend to go and in
what stages. (MIX is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound
engineering community.)

The schematic shows a central DMA Engine connecting and mediating between
two Graphics Animation processors (32 bit bus), a 32-bit RISC processor
with math co-processor, Video Decomp module, a control port, an expansion
port (where 3DO hangs its double-fast CD player), 1Mb DRAM, an optional
video port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1MB VRAM to Video
Processor to TV chain parallel with a DSP to sound chain. 

They promise Red Book CD-quality audio, full 30 fps video and a future
connection path to your PC via a PC expansion card.

I am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and
methods discussed here. The article, written by Philip De Lancie, does
cover the other machines mentioned in this thread.  I come from the PC
TCP/IP world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to
the educated consumer; 3DO seems to have the right business partners to
make this happen. 

Hope this helps.

I'll agree with your wife.  While I was a student, I had doctors remove
rather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a couple
times, usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason, and
said something like ""Gee, you've got a lot of wax in there"".  In my case,
removal of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing, and
I've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out with
warm water from a little rubber bulb every few months.  You can buy little
bulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store -
I don't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything.

One question I do have - a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated
a drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining
trapped water - said he told swimmers to do this after swimming, too.  It
works, but it stings like the devil, so I've always been content to let any
water in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get
out by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the trick.  Any
comments?

Perhaps because there is a connection here that is not there in the Mexican
variant you bring up.

That is, many (not all) extreme fundamentalist Christians use the excuse of
teaching their children Biblical morality to justify this sort of mistreatment.
I do not see many Mexicans using their Mexican heritage as an excuse for abuse.

It is indeed this judgemental, controlling legalism of many fundamentalist
Christians that has led me to reject that branch of our faith as not true
to the Gospel of Christ, the gospel of love.

I have seen this sort of thing too often, even amoung my own relatives, to
believe there is no relationship.  Judgementalism often leads to overly
strict, and thus abusive, discipline of children.
[This is not restricted to just Christian fundamentalism, it is found in
many extreme sects of other legalistic religions].

I, too, am a Christian.  But I do not condone the use of the Bible to justify
this sort of abuse.  I believe that it is only by exposing the horrors of
the misapplication of the Biblical concept of discipline that such abuses
can be stopped.

Just because someone is also a Christian does not mean we must identify
eith them. This sort of sin needs to be made public.

Traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it 
yourself if you don't mind that extra hassle.  Having a trade-in on a purchase
just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing.

>i know that the ""blue book"" value for the car is $2825.

I assume this is _retail_ bluebook.  There are two bluebook prices, one for
retail and one for wholesale.  You really want the retail price if you can 
get it.  The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage
and extras on your particular car.  You should look all this stuff up yourself.
Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country
that may not apply in your area.  For example, blue book prices are low for
California.  A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is
to call around and see what it's selling for (if any used lots have one) or
looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices.  It 
might be more time efficient to take a small loss (rather than hold out for
6 months for the best price).

>an acquaintence
>has offered to give me blue book value for the car.

I don't know what you mean by ""an acquaintance"" but I would make darn sure
that I was paid, that is, cashier's check in full before delivery.  There's
a real temptation when selling to a pseudo-friend to be more accomodating
than you should.  Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying
in full at the start (with a cashier's check or cash) then I would go
elsewhere.  Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot
or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook.  That's probably a safer approach
than selling to a private party.

I have not seen this book, though I have had several people quote it in 
support of some tendentious assertions they were making, so I have become 
curious about it.

I don't want to malign this Hislop fellow, whoever he may be, as I have only 
heard the arguments at second hand, but both of the arguments seemed to turn 
on false etymology that SEEMED to be derived from Hislop.

I would be interested in knowing more about these things. 

The first one claimed that the word ""church"" was derived from the Greek 
""cyclos"", and that it was therefore related to the worship of ""Circe"".

I don't know if Hislop is the source of this assertion, but it does seem to 
be based on false etymology.

The second claimed an etymological relationship between ""Ishtar"" and 
""Easter"", which seemed to be even more fanciful and far-fetched than some 
of the wilder notions of the British Israelites.

Regarding the latter, as far as I have been able to find out, ""Easter"" is 
derived from the old English name for April - ""Eosturmonath"". The Venerable 
Bede mentioned that this was associated with a goddess called ""Eostre"", but 
apart from that reference I have not been able to find out anything more 
about her. It also seems that the term ""Easter"" is only used by the English 
and those they evangelized. The Germans, for example, also use the term 
""Ostern"", but Germany was evangelized by English missionaries.

So I would be interested in any evidence of ""Easter"" being used for Pascha 
by people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient Anglo-
Saxons and their offshoots. Such evidence might support the claims of those 
who appear to derive the theory from Hislop.

I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss. A recent rough test
showed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. Then it falls off
a cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on.  This type of loss is difficult
to fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which
keep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desired.

Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for
several weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended to
be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. I
found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about
to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of
another programmable system called ReSound.

Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for
about 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the Widex.
Nevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I was
impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I
will give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had one
patient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound
even though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago.

The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the
Widex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on the
difference!  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money, I am
having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds. I would
appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections
about when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quite
so expensive.

It isn't that bad.  At least the Bugatti EB110 has compound curves compared
to the slab sides on the Consulier.  And the Bugatti has a quad turbo V-12
(thing of it as 4 three cylinder turbo engines tied together).  Also Ettore
Bugatti's nephew is on the board of directors and had a hand in the
development.  So that's about as much Bugatti as you are likely to get in

Most GP 500cc motorcycles are V-4s, and the VF line of Hondas were all V-4s

the present VFR-750F).  It should be noted that Lancia built a V-4 in
recent history in the Fulvia HF, a very pretty Italian coupe.

Greetings this is a general call for information regarding Image
Processing. I am looking for any material related to the field, and am
also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the
field. In particular source code for general use packages.

I already have several texts on the subject, but would appreciate more
input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself. I'm not
mathematically literate (ie. I don't have a degree in mathematics), so
any material that is suggested I would prefer that it was not
mathematically intensive.

The best book I have found on the subject at the moment is:

""Practical Digital Image Processing""
by Rhys Lewis
ISBN: 0-13-683525-2
Published by Ellis Horwood (c)1990.

Likewise I am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate
Image Processing techniques. So far I have 'xv', and 'khoros' for Unix.
'Dcview 2.1' for the IBM PC, and various related smatterings of C code
to help describe topics like, contrasting, dithering, image enhancement
via convolution etc.

If anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software
pertinent to this area, or better still if they could tell me where I am
most likely to find it on the AARNET (Internet). If I can I would prefer
source code in C or Turbo Pascal that includes some Image Processing
code/algorithms, that I can readily alter/manipulate for the purposes of
demonstration it would be most helpful.

All the above information will contribute to my post-graduate studies,
and will be liberally used in my paper, and seminar on the subject.

I have quite a problem with the idea that Mary never committed a sin.
Was Mary fully human?  If it is possible for God to miraculously make 
a person free of original sin, and free of committing sin their whole
life, then what is the purpose of the Incarnation of Jesus?  Why can't
God just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us
sinless, without the need for repentance and salvation and all that?

I don't particularly object to the idea of the assumption, or the
perpetual virginity (both of which I regard as Catholic dogma about which
I will agree to disagree with my Catholic brothers and sisters in
Christ), and I even believe in the virgin birth of Jesus, but this
concept of Mary's sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the
rest of Christian doctrine as I understand it.

this is really confusing to me, especially since i still believe that

then, i am not really biblically supported in this opinion -- or am i?

so God uses grace like margarine: he only spreads it where it's needed

although i realize this doctrine was not originally intended to cause
social problems, it ends up doing just that -- if there is supposed to
be some sort of ""sign"" that someone is elect, like lots of children or
success at work, then those who have a good life on earth will go
around thinking that those who don't are doomed to hell.

in a way, though, this sounds like the opposite idea -- those doomed
to hell will have a great life on earth.  that's almost like the
converse of what i believe -- responsibility for what we do now will
be punished after we die.  you're saying what we get after we die has
a direct bearing on how we live now?  strange....

 the idea (well, my idea) would be that you would intervene to
 establish peace and stop the atrocities.  i'm not suggesting wwIII.  i
 don't really understand what you mean by a ""just war"".  of course i am
 not an isolationist, although i see some merit in not jumping in at
 the first opportunity (can you say kuwait?).  we happen to be a big
 country with a lot of resources (as well as a lot of debt), and this
 gives us some responsibility in the world, whether we like it or not.
 flashbacks of wwII, as well as vietnam, should be haunting us.

 yet another difference of opinion.  so be it.

Arguably, it is both. Since authority is a matter of both
communicator and recepiant we can say that, for example ""Jesus
is Lord"" whether the world at large accepts the authority or
not. Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative
content whether or not it is accepted (This issue is at the
heart of Pilate's pragmatic question ""What is truth?"" to Jesus
when our Lord was brought before Him. Jesus' reply was to appeal
to the authority of his Father)
You also might like to consider the claimed authority
represented by the statements ""thus says the Lord"" in the Bible,
which claim to put across the exact words of God.

You fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of
inherant authority and claim that it lies only in the ""community
of faith"" - does something become truth because it is accepted?
The main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward
direction as well as a manward (which is where the reference to
Rev 22 came in.)

>

If we narrowed it down to the predictive elements - which will
cut out some of the 39 accepted OT books as well - we
nonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the
book: Jesus' standards were that ""Scripture cannot be broken"".
Can you name a single prophecy that fits the bill in the Apocrapha?
(ie definitely fulfilled AFTER it has been written)

>

Does it have a subjective 'ring of truth' about it - and does
other evidence that has come to light contradict or confirm the
authenticity? (archaeological, other textual evidence for
example)

>: 4. Is it dynamic?
>
>What is this supposed to mean?  Many of the apocryphal books are highly

What this is getting at is the relationship between text and
reader. It is to do with the quality of writing, which should
have the ability to fire the mind, affect our thought life and
cause us to act in a certain way - there is something of this
in Jesus' quote: ""Man does not live by bread alone, but by every
word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord"". (Matt 4.4)

Does the Catholic Church give the same authority to the
Apocrapha as to the accepted 66 books? Certainly it is not as
widely used as the OT and NT.

Think about what I have said above. You may want to revise your
conclusion. In addition think about other 'sacred writings', eg
the Koran, the book of Mormon and how and why you would
categorise them using the above principles. One word of caution
- you may find some 'reflected glory' in some of these books: in
that the 'inspired quality' may be derived from the Bible.
Remember that Lucifer is quite capable of appearing as an angel
of light and quoting Scripture.

We've lost the point and the context here. I am not arguing that
the statement in Rev. can be applied indescriminately, just that
the whole acceptance/rejection idea does not just follow on from
man-made traditions - but there is I believe an act of God
involved in the selection and criteria of what is classified as
Scripture and comes under the definition of 2Tim 3.16.

Hi all,
	I am working on a project in which I need to brake an image
into sub-bands and then work with them.  Since I have never done
anything like this, don't even understand the concept of sub-bands, I
was wondering if there is some software out there that would allow me
to do this.  Any hints?
Thanks,

	Actually, for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth than
you need, unless there's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed
HDTV.  Also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB,
even using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or
18 should be enough for a moving picture).  1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB (I'm
guessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600, I'm fairly
sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).

	I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB/s while
displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system.

	Unless you have a _very_ compelling reason, I'd advise trying to use
at least somewhat compressed data.  You don't have to go to full compression
to get to a level where the data IO requirements are much cheaper and easier
to deal with.

Robert,

I'm *so* glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion.  I've 
been compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med.
I didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just 
like I haven't read ""The Yeast Connection"").

Let me just start by stating that the authors of the ""Cold Fusion"" papers of 
recent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually 
left the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if a 
review of the research notes of the ""cold fusion scientists"" actually 
proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.

Your sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay 
texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food 
combining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind.
But some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent 
oxidative damage in the body).

Your experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove 
that you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you 
use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees 
I believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in 
commercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this 
kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I 
couldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really 
guessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is 
that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to 
produce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so 
they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. 

Chemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and 
in our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve 
fusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we 
really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with 
silicon?  Not in my book Robert.

Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculation 
that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon 
based life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I 
know enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to 
separate the fiction from the fact.

Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in 
humans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doing 
there?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know 
about silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not 
because silicon is transformed into calcium).

Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective 
tissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show 
that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective 
factor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, 
the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity 
which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as 
part of the ageing process in humans).

For bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which 
calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon 
in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the 
bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.
Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming 
cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in 
the gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency
(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of 
defective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also 
another big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an  
undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not 
transformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing 
observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into 
calcium is an interesting little trick.

But Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and 
yes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without 
a very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group 
are flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any 
better).

If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, 
I'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources 
that come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems 
to make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm 
going to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us 
kindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that label.

For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's 
interesting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric 
neurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or his 
name(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in 
our Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with 
brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses""unconventional""
treatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one 
case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional 
treatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the 
cost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between 
radiation treatment and surgery is guys? 

I'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the 
chronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine)
and tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which 
do not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it 
because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are?
How about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your 
sinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).

Yes.  For examples of this in the writings of the early fathers, consider:

    You alone and your Mother
        are more beautiful than any others;
    For there is no blemish in you,
        nor any stains upon your Mother.
    Who of my children
        can compare in beauty to these?

    but a Virgin whom grace has made inviolate, free of every stain of sin.

There are many others.

No.  We have, for instance:

    Was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of
    Holy Mary, and being questioned, did not immediately add, ""the Virgin""?
    ... And to Holy Mary, Virgin is invariably added, for that Holy Woman
    remains undefiled.
                -- St. Epiphanus of Salamis, ""Panacea against all heresies"",
                   between A.D. 374-377.

    We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine
    about children of Mary ... For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen
    to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent
    as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord, home of the Eternal
    King, with the seed of human intercourse.  Anyone who proposes this is
    merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin.
                -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of 
                   Thessalonica, A.D. 392

Note that St. Augustine's conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387.  I
don't know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was, but I'm quite
sure it was after 392.  The belief in Mary's perpetual virginity originated
long before Augustine's time.  We hold that it originated with the 
Apostles.

Strictly speaking, however, Mary's perpetual virginity is independent
of her Immaculate Conception.  Mary could have been Immaculately 
Conceived and not remained a virgin; she could have remained a virgin
and not been Immaculately Conceived.

>Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with
>a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition
>because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science

>Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.

No.  It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original
sin was transmitted at conception, when a person's life begins.
Biology had nothing to do with it.  Prayerfully reflecting on the
truth of Mary's sinlessness, and the means by which God could have
achieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate
Conception.  Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine,
but the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.

The celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was
given by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a precept
feast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21).

>Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She 
>refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old 
>would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed
>to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.

No.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is not
based on private revelation.  The most that private revelation can do
is enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation,
which ended with the death of St. John the Apostle.

Second, the ""case for the doctrine"" was irreformably sealed in 1854 
with the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull ""Ineffabilis Deus"" by
Pope Pius IX.  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as
a dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to be
believed by the faithful.

The apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.  The most
that might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation
of 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has never
claimed that, nor shall she.

In Christ's Peace,

Yes, those who apply it hatefully would be better served if they if
they could alter the Bible to reflect their views:

Scene 1:  A well in Samaria:

Woman:  But I have no husband.
Jesus:  Yo!  Everybody!  Listen up!  Get your rocks ready!  We'll have
        some good biblical fun.  Here she is whispering to me that
        she doesn't have a husband, yet I know by my secret powers that
        she has had five of them!  (You know how these Samaritans are!
        And worse, she's living with a guy now that she's not even married
        to.  Now I believe in loving her, and if you'll just raise up
        those rocks like the bible allows and threaten her with a good
        stoning, she'll understand how much we hate the sin but love
        the sinner.   We must keep our priorities strait, lest folks
        2,000 years from now misunderstand me and believe I canceled
        all sin!

Scene 2:  Golgatha

2nd Thief:  You got a raw deal, man.  They didn't catch you doing anything
            wrong like they caught me.

Bleeding Jesus:  Now, son.  Let me be real clear.  You say you did something
            wrong, but are you repenting?  I need to be absolutely certain
            cause if you repent, I have a nice room for you in heaven,
            but if you think you might go thieving again, I have to
            cancel your reservation.  It is nice of you to have pity on
            me while I'm hanging here, but you must understand, this is
            all an act; I'm not really hurting.  I'm God, you see.  And
            the point of all this is to teach you to be perfect like me.
            If you think a simple kind remark to me in suffering is going
            to get you any favors, you'd better think twice!  But if you
            will just REPENT, you will become a Fundelical in Good 
            Standing.

NNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net
Summary: Why the repeated leaks?
Keywords: clutch master cyl problems

I have both an '84 and an '86 Camry, each with manual 5-speed transmissions.
The '84 has about 105,000 miles on it and the '86 about 83,000 miles.  ABout
a year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was        
leaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid
back into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and
got a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem
licked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months
later!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure
there were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I
didn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch
hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I
would be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the
problem.

I should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the
pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in
order to actuate the clutch.

My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal,
the angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the
cylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.

What do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix
short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?

Now the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain
why all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the
passenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which
the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  What
can you suggest here?

Many thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...

The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Catherine Laboure, a nun of the
sisters of Charity on July 18, 1830 at Rue du Bac, Paris.

Sister Catherine was awakened late that night by a small boy, age 5
or 6, who was literally glowing with some sort of interior light. 
The child led her to the sanctuary of the chapel where he promised
the Virgin Mary was to be found awaiting her. Our Lady appeared to
her and instructed her for two hours or more on matters pertaining
to her life and to the future of France and the world.

On November 27 Our Lady appeared again to Catherine. She instructed
her to have a medal struck. She told her that those who wore this 
medal would enjoy special protection from the Mother of God and would
receive great graces. In less than a year there were three more
apparitions. In June of 1831 the medals were a reality. Many reports
were received by those who wore it. Within two years of its issuing
the medal was known as the ""Miraculous Medal"". Catherine died in 1876.
Her body to this day is remarkably preserved (incorrupt). She was
canonized on July 27, 1947. Her body lies in the chapel at the
motherhouse on the Rue du Bac where she had her first meeting with
Our Lady.

The apparition on November 27 1830 was of average height and clothed
in white with a veil that flowed over the head and fell to the floor.
Above the altar, a pyramid painted to represent God's all knowing
wisdom looked down on them. Our Lady's feet rested on a white globe
and there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she was
stepping on. In her hands was a golden ball that represented the world.
Great streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed 
Catherine an image of two hearts, the Sacred Heart wrapped in
piercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword. The sword
represented her suffering with Jesus.

The apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarned
that a dark era lay in the immediate future. It was the apparition 
leading up to the recent ones. Our Lady began to dispense secrets.
And with the globe she revealed herself in worldwide dispute
with the forces of the dark. She told Catherine ""The times are
evil. Misfortunes will fall upon France. The throne will be
overturned. The entire world will be overcome by evils of all
kinds.""

Refer to books on St. Catherine for more of Our Lady's messages.
A copy of the medal is also available in Catholic bookstores.

I will post other Marian events every few days or so including
the ones happening today which are still under investigation.
These postings serve only to introduce you to these events.
Please look more into them and understand the reason for 
the increasing number and urgency of these apparitions.

Does anyone know how to reset the service indicator of a BMW after changing
the oil yourself?

Also, I have about 3,000 miles on my 525i and so far only one of the five
yellow service indicators went out. That means I don't need oil service until
it reach approximatly 15,000 miles which doesn't make sense to me. Any idea?

PS of cause I did my first oil change at 1,200 miles

Well, the Opel deal fell through...

Now i'm looking at a Datsun 240Z for sale in our local buy&sell.  Any
previous owners have any experience with these cars?  Besides looking
for rust,good compression,low miles, and all the other usual car
things one looks for, is there anything special about these cars that
I should watch out for?

How about things like handling,performance,mileage,etc.  These cars
look hot, to my eyes at least, and bear more than a passing
resemblance to the Aston Martin DB4 Zagato(sp?), which has to be one
of the most beatiful cars ever made.

What is the difference between 240Z, 260Z, 280Z?  The 280ZX is rather 
unappealing IMHO, but the other cars are decent.
Thanks again...

I include the key verse (D&C 68:25) because others
may not have the reference.

""And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion,
or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach
them not to understand the doctrine of repentance,
faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of
baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying
on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be
upon the heads of the parents.""

What is ""the sin"" of the parents?

>Ezekiel 18:20 ""The soul who sins is the one who will die.  The son will not

>Is Ezekiel 18 not translated correctly in your eyes perhaps?

Ezekiel 18 teaches a correct principle.
However, it assumes that fathers and sons have 
equal knowledge to prepare for the judgment.

Parents are responsible to teach their children
the Gospel and other life skills.  Should they
fail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their 
children, the parent would be held responsible
-- not for their children's sins, but for not
teaching them properly.

Whenever the Lord installs someone to a position 
of authority in either the family or the church He
expects that person to teach those in his charge.

In Ezekiel 33:7-9 someone called to care for others 
is likened to ""a watchman unto the house of Israel.""
""If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from 
his way, that man shall die in his iniquity; but
his blood will I require at thine hand.
Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to 
turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he
shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast
delivered thy soul.""

Even though the D&C prefaces this commandment with
""parents have children in Zion"" I believe all
parents are responsible for teaching their children 
whatever good principles they understand.
However, LDS parents accept greater responsbility
and could be judged more strictly.

Hi.

My wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp?) deficiency over the past year
that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep, coldness and proneness
to gaining weight. She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?)
tests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) are
not very interested in starting medication as this ""deactivates"" the 
gland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple of 
monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given
some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the 
'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language,
but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the 
brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.) 

My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach?
Her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on the
probability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eat
normally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels
that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this
affect the treatment, development?

I can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and I
will greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic.

I don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the established
medical profession or a praise for alternatives, I am just relaying
events as they have happened.

Actually I am entering vet school next year, but the question is 
relevant for med students too.

Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically.
Since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy, 
histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass 
memorization -- I am a little concerned.  As I am sure most 
med students are.

Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  I 
have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like
thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  But I have
never applied them to large amounts of ""data"".

Has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, or
cheap software?   

Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  Being an
older student who returned to school this year, organization (another
one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success.

Please no griping about how all you have to do is ""learn"" the material
conceptually.  I have no problem with that, it is one of my strong 
points.  But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is
rote memorization.

I remember a couple of times when my ex-girlfriend said that she thought she
was blessed because of her son (whom she loved dearly). In fact, I've heard
people refer to someone as being blessed quite a few times. It's a common

Hmm... 48 bit aye?
Well, it beats a 32-bit design for thee sake of ellegance.
48 bit means 16 bits per primary colour.
The 2^48 nr of colours is a bit misleading. It makes more sense to see it
as 65536 possible shades of pure red.
This might actually make some sense, since 256 shades of red (24 bit colours) 
may produce visible 'jumps' in intensity.
Then again, a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way 
of doing colour graphics, because it leaves ya such a tidy (and fast) program
code.

	Take care,

One more way, which works in manual trans cars I've driven, and it is my
personal favorite (the other suggestions above are great, but try this
one, too).  

While pushing the shifter *gently* towards reverse, let the clutch out
slowly (right to the friction point) and the shifter will be pulled into
position. If you do it right, the car won't jump backward, nor will the
gears grind.... You will just glide back.

Exactly...

I didn't want to mess with tga or rle.  So I wrote the following script. 
All you need is the very standard set of pbm utilities. 

This script is a .pov to .jpg converter.  Just run it like this:

  pov2jpg 1280 1024 fred.pov 

You will need to modify the path's in the script to reflect where you put
povray and its include files.  If you have a problem with disk space, you
can use named pipes instead of temporary files.

I hope you find it useful...

Metal music after you became a Christian? You know there are Christian bands 
like Barren Cross, Whitecross, Bloodgood and Stryper, that play that kind of 
music. I like some of it, I feel like it sometimes. Of course I listen to 
the lyrics too. I don't listen to any Christian band, but it's better than 
listening to secular music anyway.

[Deleted for space; basically complaints that xv is an 8 bit program and that

In reverse order:

1) Try clicking in the auto-apply box to switch it off. Then make your mods. Then
click on apply. There is no problem as stated; it has already been solved if you
look carefully.

2) Yes XV is an 8 bit program. This is not a bug. You can edit individual pallette
entries or do global colour changes; crop, scale etc. Clearly the program must
save out the *altered* image else all your work would be thrown away. So yes it
saves out 8 bit images - of course!

XV can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. This is a handy
facility, not a bug.

How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How would you group
'related' colours to edit them together? Only global changes could be done
unless the software were very different and much more complicated.

If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much more powerfull
software - which is readily available commercially.

And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It can be applied to any image of
arbitrary bit depth. Again, this is not a bug. It is a way of saving disk space
;-)

I just went back to the chapter in Cecil on chronic hepatitis.  It seems
that indeed most cases of CPH are persistant viral hepatitis, whereas
there are a multitude of potential and probable causes for CAH (viral,
drugs, alcohol, autoimmune, etc.).  Physicians seem to have a variety of
""thresholds"" for electing to biopsy someone's liver.  Personally, I think
that if the patient is asymptomatic, with only slight transaminitis and
normal albumin and PT, one can simply follow them closely and not add the
potential risks of a biopsy.  Others may well biopsy such a patient, thus
providing these samples for study.  It would be interesting to see if
anyone's done any decision analysis on this.

Well, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by
Compuserve back in 1987(?) or so.  It was to create a format that could be
read and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has
a built in compression scheme (LZW?).

IFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package
images, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file.  IFF was
created by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga.
It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga.
The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeaved
BitMap?) but many others exist.  This format supports 24 bit color images.

Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at
zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory /pub/graphics.formats
(Taken from the FAQ for this news group.)  :)

Not sure of this but I think some millipedes cause a toxic reaction (sting?

Three possible results after interview:
1) rejection outright
2) acceptance outright
3) the infamous 'wait list'... 

If you are on a 'wait list', your entrance into medical school
is dependent upon some other applicant withdrawing their
acceptance.  This can happen as late as day -1 of starting
classes.

You can always call the admissions office.  The secretaries
should have some idea of when a decision might be made on your
application.  Be calm, respectful, and friendly; secretaries
have more power than you might realize, and you never know-
could be the dean of admissions answering the phone.

> Also does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in, i

If you don't get in this year, sit down and re-evaluate
yourself: your motives, desires, and goals that are directing
you into medicine; your academic and extracurricular
accomplishments.  Make a decision about whether you *really*
want to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped out
in the first semester of med school because they found it was
not what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four
years in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as a
career is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T be
pushed into it because of your parents/family/significant
other.  

If you still want to be a medical doctor, determine how you
can improve your application.  A letter of recommendation from
a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive
recommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famous
professor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also, don't
be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest
and positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no,
sorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no, sorry'.  I
have turned down writing recommendations for some students
because I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful
comments, and some because I honestly could not recommend them
at that point.  

Rewrite your personal statement; take it by an English
professor or some other friendly person with skill and
experience in writing and proof-reading and get their
criticism, both about what you are saying as well as how you
say it.

Review your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor
in some area, don't be afraid to spend some time in further
coursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help
here.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut
courses, it usually shows.

Look at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in
local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus;
substantial leadership roles in an organization help also.
Beware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to
spot and weed out.

Overall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and why
you want to get there, combined with an honest self-appraisal
of skills and aptitude, will be the best path to take in
applying to any program, medical or what-have-you.

Good luck with the process -- as Tom Petty says, 'the waiting
is the hardest part', at least emotionally. :)

     I posted about a ""pulse of (relaxation) electricity"".  I now think
it more like a pulse of ""relaxation"" or comfort than a pulse of
electricity.  It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling
of comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.

     Another thing.  When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with your
palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then you
relax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  So,
you feel a ""shiver"" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat).
Then this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam you
hear loudens.  (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down
in bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  This
roam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of your
body.

     ""Shiver"" is not the word.  It may be called a mild vibration or quake.
What is this shiver and roam?  Can I use this to induce out-of-body
experience?

It may be a good way to catch a cold.  It's easy to pick up cold
viruses on your fingers, either from touching a contaminated surface,
or by shaking hands with someone that has a cold.  Then putting your
fingers in your nose will transfer the viruses to your nose.

Yes, I suppose that's true.  Of course, notice I qualified with NEARLY
every language :-).  And there are missionaries out there who can
speak every imaginable language AND dialect.  But then, the fact that
not all languages have a WRITTEN gospel lends no credence to the

in these places of un-written language, but rather in churches full
of people who do have a written language and a Bible in that language.

But I nitpick.

Corel Draw will do it; version 2 onwards. If you have version 1 perhaps an
upgrade is in order.

Another alternative would be to use a different bureau that can take PostScript.

Subject: ARSENOKOITAI: Scroggs (#3)
Organization: FNAL/AD/Net
Lines: 199

[cont. Dr. James DeYoung; #3]

R. Scroggs

     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and
suggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a
""Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic
terminology.""  The term is derived from Lev 18""22 & 20:13 where the LXX
juxtaposes the two words arsenos (""male"") and koiten (""bed""), and represents
the Hebrew miskab zabar (""lying with a male"").   Yet he believes that Paul did
not originate the term, but borrowed it from ""circles of Hellenistic Jews
acquainted with rabbinic discussions"" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid
""contact with the usual Greek terminology"" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs
observes, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions
of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to
native-speaking Greeks (108).

     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the
object of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's ""learned discussion""
(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of ""one who lies with a
male"" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),
which Scroggs interprets as ""the effeminate call-boy,"" arsenokoitai is the
active partner ""who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on
occasion to satisfy his sexual desires"" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not
refer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic
model of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he
affirms (109).
     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The
combination of pornoi (""fornicators""), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (""slave
dealers"") refers to ""male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave
dealers [who procure them]"" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of
pederasty ""which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual
purposes, and the use of these boys by adult males"" (121).  Even ""serious
minded pagan authors"" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these
instances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently
general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. 
Consequently Paul ""Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind"" (122).
We cannot know what Paul would have said about the ""contemporary model of
adult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships"" (122).

     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical
concerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of
vices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and
function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any
relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually
nonexistent.  He concludes that Paul ""does not care about any specific item in
the lists"" (104). 

     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary
phenomenon of a ""catalogue of vices,""  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are
""irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today"" (129).  The ""model
in today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model
attacked by the NT"" that ""Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not
relevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational
discussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify
refusal of ordination. . . "" (127).

      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI

D. Wright

     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have
come under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's
view is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out
several shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults
Boswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev
18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the ""Apostolic
Constitutions,""  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). 
Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term
derives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This
is significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's
claim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the
gender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean ""a male who sleeps with
a male,"" making arseno- the object.

     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the
term, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that
compounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it
as an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely
one of dialectical diversity: ""No semantic import attaches to the difference
between the two forms"" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which
the second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its
object and where ""the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its
gender"" (132). 

     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright
takes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. 
For example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,
androbaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male
homosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite
Hippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the
Syriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to
the Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). 

     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in
parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the
dominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this
parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (""adultery""), porneia
(""fornication""), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris
(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the
Ten Commandments as ""You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (""you shall not commit
adultery""), ou paidophthoreseis (""you shall not practice homosexuality with
boys""), you shall not steal. . ."" (150 n. 43).

     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (""commit homosexuality"") exists in the
Sibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was
coined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by
Or.Sib., book 2 (137-38).

     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew
upon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John
the Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of
homosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.

     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be
absent ""from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted
(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to
the first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used
dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.
Didache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing
Scripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). 

     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention
(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,
omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a
long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom
1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright
observes that Boswell has ""signally failed to demonstrate any us of
arsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual
activity"" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature
and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly
specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. 

     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim
and I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning
""homosexual"" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of
the word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited
conclusion based on them.

     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the
catalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed
in late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of
homosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the
part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into
being under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke ""generally of
male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual
engagement with paides"" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were
interchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).

     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning
homosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and
others who limit the term to ""active male prostitutes"" or pederasty are without
significant support from linguistic and historical studies.  

[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we
get into the ""good"" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will
include ""Symposium"" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern
understanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of
Paul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of
Lev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done
away with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the
general.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our
culture, should stick around for this one.]

Independently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is
made in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from
146BC to AD 1100).
14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in
Rom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.
Zaas, ""I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP
17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai
were part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the
vice list, ""and such were some of you,"" indicate that ""Paul is addressing real
or potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by
rote"" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry
(147).
15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, ""Relations
Natural and Unnatural""  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,"" JRE
14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.
16  D.F. Wright, ""Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I
Cor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.
17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, ""ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,""
effectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. 
He finds the meaning to be general, ""a male who has sex with a male"" (4-11).  
18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.
19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the
references to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.
DeYoung, ""A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and
Pseudepigrapha,"" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.
20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai
points to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently
""why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,
and why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?""  (152 n.
71)  In a more recent article, ""Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,"" EvQ
61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a
""remarkable originality"" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).

     The questions raised by Moore et al. about recombinant gp160  envelope 
glycoprotein precursor from HIV-1 produced by  MicroGeneSys are advantages 
rather than disadvantages, write  Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith of 
MicroGeneSys in Meriden,  Conn.  Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus

recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virus 
does in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in 
patients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immune 
responses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and 
CD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  never 
intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein.  Antibody 
responses against native HIV-1 proteins,  including the types described by 
Moore et al., exist in nearly  all AIDS patients but do not prevent

progression of HIV disease.  In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120-
antibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific 
activation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which  
may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4 
binding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added 
safety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts, 
stimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune 
function.  Based on  these and other clinical results, MicroGeneSys gp160 was 
chosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  first 
phase III vaccine therapy studies, conclude Volvovitz and  Smith.

""HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission"" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 
341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline) 

     There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive 
women breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.  The 
anti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers of 
leukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic  
activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to 
barely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to 
twelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA.  
Breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory 
illnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive 
mothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV-
1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than 
bottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slower 
progression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer 
protection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties of 
milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA 
antibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against 
core antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a 
human  milk factor.  In the developing world, where infectious disease  and 
malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk is 
still the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's HIV status.  
Transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early 
milk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breast 
milk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and  
may even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok.

et al. of the University of Miami  School of Medicine in Miami, Fla.  The 
researchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and 
attempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing.  Living patients 
with newly detected HIV infection were interviewed, and DNA sequence  analysis 
was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of the 
dentist.  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the 
medical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug 
abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.  
There were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124  
were deceased.  An examination of the death certificates of  patients 
identified five who had died with HIV infection, all of  whom were either 
homosexuals or IV-drug users.  The researchers  were able to detect 962 of the 
remaining 1,048 patients, and 900  agreed to be tested.  HIV infection was 
reported in five of the  900 patients, including four who had clear evidence 
of risk  factors for the disease.  One patient who had only a single  
evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior.  Comparative DNA sequence 
analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patients 
were not closely related.  The study  suggests the potential for HIV 
transmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting 
in which  universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude Dickinson  et

     Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once, which makes the 
resurging health hazard harder to control, according to a  study published in 
today's New England Journal of Medicine.   People who contract TB usually 
develop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria 
again.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight 
off a  new TB infection, doctors found.  Peter M. Small of the Howard  Hughes 
Medical Institute at Stanford University, director of the  study, said that in 
order to protect against reinfection, it may  be necessary for some people to 
use TB medicines permanently.   The study examined the genetic makeup of TB 
bacteria and how the  germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County 
Hospital  in New York.

anti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers of

leukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic  
activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to 
barely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to 
twelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA.  
Breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory 
illnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive 
mothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV-
1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than 
bottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slower 
progression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer 
protection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties of 
milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA 
antibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against 
core antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a 
human  milk factor.  In the developing world, where infectious disease  and 
malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk is 
still the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's HIV status.  
Transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early 
milk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breast 
milk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and  
may even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok.

""HIV and the Aetiology of AIDS"" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 957  
(Duesberg, Peter) 

     Because there is no proof that HIV is the cause of AIDS, the  hypothesis 
that drug use leads to AIDS will hopefully become a  hindrance to the 
physiologically (AZT) and psychologically  (positive AIDS test) toxic public 
health initiatives, writes  Peter Duesberg of the University of California--
Berkeley.  In the Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg's  
hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to 
AIDS, ""a hindrance to public health initiatives.""   However, their hypothesis 
that HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits.  
The U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, 
no prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this 
hypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4  
depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies 
against HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals 
from Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug-
AIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug-
free AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT  
use altogether.  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have to 
produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years 
HIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same 
AIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.  The 10 year period is claimed by

proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS.  
Alternatively, they could show that HIV-free  individuals who have used drugs 
for 10 years never get  AIDS-defining illnesses, concludes Duesberg.

""Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1  Infection"" 
Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 959   (Vento, Sandro et al.) 

     Interferon (IFN), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseases 
in some settings, may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some  HIV-1 infected 
individuals through the amplification of harmful  ""autoimmune"" reactions, 
write Sandro Vento et al. of the A.  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy.  
The researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with 
hepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid,  
profound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the 
observation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had 
circulating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at the 
end of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 
contained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the  
aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens, 
homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41.  
These autoantibodies, which also  recognize ""native"" class II molecules and 
may contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells ""in vivo"", were at low tires 
(50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such  
autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and 
HCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss 
in some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful 
""autoimmune"" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA 
antigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell 
counts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very  
rapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with 
these HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude.

""TB Makes a Comeback"" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6   
(Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.) 

     Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United 
States, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants, 
minorities, and prisoners.  Dr. Lee B.  Reichman, professor of medicine at the 
University of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American Lung 
Association,  said, ""Right now, it's a big city problem, but potentially it's  
everyone's problem.""  The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans  are infected 
with TB, and about 10 percent of them will develop  the disease because their 
immune systems are depressed,  especially those with AIDS or HIV.  Gene

Tammes, a Centers for  Disease Control expert, said that is why the CDC has 
issued  guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix AIDS  with TB 
patients.  State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because 
those who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with 
treatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public 
health services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic ""because the number of 
cases  is increasing faster than we can treat people,"" said Dr. George  
Diferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According to 
Diferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of 
diagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City 
residents don't  complete therapy.  When TB patients don't finish taking their  
medication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking more 
expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to 
treat.

 ""Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern 
Florida: Artifact or Reality?"" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol. 
83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.) 

     The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in 
southern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write 
Okey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga.  
The researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal 
Palm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual 
transmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, 
or  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route 
of HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to records 
from social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexually 
transmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor 
was found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a  
standardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were 
reviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission 
categories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the 
percentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties 
between January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to 
heterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men 
and from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of  
heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after 
adjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the 
national average, the researchers  conclude.

Elisabeth, let's set the record straight for the nth time, I have not read 
""The Yeast Connection"".  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing 
by this ""hated"" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me?
Elisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition.
A book that you should be familiar with and not ""hate"". ""Candida species 
colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly 
thereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  
Indeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic 
mycosis.""  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic 
infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or 
""sick"" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent 
parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.
Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute 
it.

What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic 
infection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation
(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial 
competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida 
blooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: ""However, some factors, such as 
the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to 
both mucosal and systemic infections"".  I was addressing mucosal infections
(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers 
this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the ""cure"".  I guess that 
your nutrition course does not, too bad.

My, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you 
noticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist.
Candida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you point 
out, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells, 
pseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist 
and that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot of 
Greek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.

You know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small 
little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in 
Sci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too.
I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what 
I've said, that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into 
""The Yeast Connection"" book because I don't know what's in that book, plain 
and simple. And to be honest with you, I'm beginning to wish that it was never 
written.

    [First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what
Joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.
They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that
does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and
punishment.
     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not
the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had
refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the
good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.]


So what you're saying then, is that God exercises direct control, or
influence upon humanity. He doesn't control our every thought or action,
but takes what we do, whether it be intended for evil or not, and turns
it into something good. It seems to me, that this idea conflicts with
the belief that God gave humans FREE WILL. As far as I can determine,
it is impossible to reconcile these two different ideas. If God were to
exert his influence upon anyone or anything at anytime, he would be 
impeding upon someone's free will. Unless, of course, you believe that
God did not give us complete and unabated free will, but rather, some sort
of conditional free will. Something that allows us to make our own choices
and control our own lives except when God wants to use us to fulfill some
good purpose of his own by ""hardening our heart"" or controlling us in some
other way. I hear alot of people who look at various events, mostly 
catastrophies or things like the AIDS epidemic and make comments about
God's will. I have a very difficult time understanding why people believe
that God controls anything that happens on this planet. Except, possibly
when being asked to through someone's prayer. According to the Bible,
Pharoah was going to let Moses' people go after one or two plagues, but
God kept hardening his heart so Moses could cast all 7 plagues upon the
Egyptians, the last plague causing the death of many innocent children.
So then, God impeded upon Pharoah's free will and used him as a puppet.
God did this not just to free the Hebrews, but to free them in some sort
of a grand fashion. I suppose from the Hebrew's point of view, this could
be seen as turning something bad into good, but I'm sure the Egyptians didn't
see it this way. All of your examples of how God turned something bad into
something good are based upon showing favortism to one group of people over
another. After all, it's only good based upon your point of view. Why does
God, who is supposed to be the god of all of humanity, play favorites?

Q. Should teenagers have the freedom to choose what church they go to?

My friends teenage kids do not like to go to church.
If left up to them they would sleep, but that's not an option.
They complain that they have no friends that go there, yet don't
attempt to make friends. They mention not respecting their Sunday
school teacher, and usually find a way to miss Sunday school but
do make it to the church service, (after their parents are thoroughly
disgusted) I might add. A never ending battle? It can just ruin your
whole day if you let it.

Fred Gilham asks (May 11) whether it is true that Kurt Goedel wrote
a version of the ontological argument for the existence of God.

Yes, he did. He did not publish it, but it will be published by the
Oxford University Press in German and with English translation in
Volume 3, due to appear this fall, of his Collected Works.

Meanwhile, you can find a summary, or perhaps the whole thing, in an
article by Jordan Howard Sobel called ""Goedel's ontological proof""
in the book ON BEING AND SAYING, edited by Judith Jarvis Thompson
(sp?), published by the MIT Press in 1987.

Professor C Anthony Anderson of the Philosophy Department of the
University of Minnesota has written an article, ""Some Emendations of
Goedel's Ontological Proof,"" which appeared in the magazine FAITH
AND PHILOSOPHY, v. 7 (1990): 291-303. It discusses some objections
that various critics have raised against Goedel's proof, and offers
a revised version of the proof that is not vulnerable to these
objections.

Early in Church history, the catechumens were dismissed prior to the celebration 
of the Eucharist.  It WAS secret, giving rise to the rumors that Christians
were cannibals and all sorts of perverse claims.  The actions were considered
too holy to be observed by non-Christians, as well as potentially dangerous
for the individual Christian who might be identified.

If everything I've read is correct, Ford is doing nothing but ""re-
skinning"" the existing Mustang, with MINOR suspension modifications.
And the pictures I've seen indicate they didn't do a very good job
of it.  

The ""new"" mustang, is nothing but a re-cycle of a 20 year old car.

As I recall from my bout with kidney stones, there isn't any

Either they pass, or they have to be broken up with sound, or they have
to be extracted surgically.

When I was in, the X-ray tech happened to mention that she'd had kidney

 Columbus was indeed a crank, but not in the manner you think.

 The fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail.  It was
 also well known that the circumference was about 25K miles, and that you could
 not reach Asia bo going west with current technology -- you would neither be
 able to carry enough supplies, nor get a long enough stretch of good sailing
 weather.  Nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world.  Instead,
 they expected him to die at sea.

 Columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only 16K miles,
 making the trip practical.

 Unfortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, the Earth's circumference is
 indeed 25K miles.

 Fortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, there was a stopping place right
 about where Asia would have been had the circumference been 16K miles.

and reincarnation as I see the matter from an anthroposophical and 
a Christian point of view.

1. Karma is not simple reward and punishment dealt out by a ""judging
   deity"".

2. Reincarnation is not the same as being born again.

3. Reincarnation is not the same as the resurrection of the body.

4. Reincarnation and karma do not contradict the fundamental teachings
   of Christianity about God, the fall, the being. incarnation, death,
   and resurrection of Christ, his coming again, sin, grace, forgiveness, 
   salvation, and the last judgement.

Origen's work was mostly lost. He was not anathematized, to my knowledge, 
but his writing comes down largely in fragments and quotations from enemies.
Perhaps someone else can comment on Origen.  I don't know if there
is a specific statement about reincarnation from him, but from what I do
know about him he probably did hold to the teaching in one form or another.

I don't know too much about the history of the idea of reincarnation in
the Church. However, I heard an interesting story about Pope John Paul II
from an astronomer who teaches at the University of Cracow.  The Pope likes
to go to Poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so he
can relax and talk Polish to friends and fellow countrymen.  My acquaintance,
an anthroposophist, related the fact that Woitila knew about Steiner and
Anthroposophy from his early days.  Before he became a priest he was an
actor in a dramatic company in Cracow whose leader was a pupil of Steiner
and based his acting and directing methods on Steiner's indications.  Part
of the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy.  Well,
going to this conference with him a few years ago, the astronomer and another
Polish anthroposophist thought they would ask the Pope what he thought about
Anthroposophy.  They chickened out at the last minute, but one of them did ask
him what he thought about reincarnation.  The Pope smiled and said, 
""Actually there have been quite a few good Catholics who believed in 
reincarnation,"" and he proceeded to name several from the earliest times
to modern times.  Then he changed the subject. My Polish friend did not
say whether Origen was among those he mentioned.

Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com) 

[As far as I know Origen himself was not anathematized.  He was
controversial, but avoided outright condemnation during his lifetime.
However some of his views were condemned at a Council in Alexandria in
400 and two councils in Constantinople in 543 and 553.  I am fairly
sure the preexistence of souls is one of the doctrines condemned.

Sorry, I put my foot in my mouth, concerning the church's history.
It is correct to say that the Council of Hippo 393 listed the 
deuterocanonical books among those accepted for use in the
church, and that this was ratified by the Council of Carthage,
and by Pope Innoent I and Gelasius I (414 AD).

Yet Eerdman's History of the Church says: 

""At the end of the fourth century views still differed in regard to
the extent of the canon, or the number of the books which should
be acknowledged as divine and authoritative.

   The Jewish canon, or the Hebrew bible, was universally 
received, while the Apocrypha added to the Greek version
of the Septuagint were only in a general way accounted as books
suitable for church reading, and thus as a middle class between
canonical and strictly apocryphal (pseudonymous) writings.
And justly; for those books, while they have great historical
value, and fill the gap between the Old Testament and the New,
all originated after the cessation of prophecy, and the cannot
be therefore regarded as inspired, nor are they ever cited
by Christ or the aposteles.""

""In the Western church the canon of both Testaments was closed
at the end of the fourth century through the authority of
Jerome (who wavered, however, between critical doubts and the
principle of tradition), and more especially of Augustine,
who firmly followed the Alexandrian canon of the Septuagint,
and the preponderant tradition in reference to the Catholic
Epistles and the Revelation; though he himself, in some
places, inclines to consider the Old Testament Apocrypha
as *deutero* canonical, bearing a subordinate authority.""

This history goes on to say that Augustine attended both the
Council of Hippo and of Carthage.

It is interesting to note, however, the following footnote to
the fourth session of the Council of Trent.  The footnote 
lists various Synods which endorsed lists of canonical 
books, but then says ""The Tridentine list or decree was the
first *infallible* and effectually promulgated declaration
on the Canon of the Holy Scriptures.""

Which leads one to think that the RC canon was not official
until Trent.  Thus my previous erroneous statement was
not entirely groundless.

It is also interesting to note that the Council of Trent
went on to uphold ""the old Latin Vulgate Edition"" of 
the Scriptures as authentic.  Which, I would suppose, 
today's Catholic scholars wish the Council had never said.
Also the council made no distinction between deutero-canonical
and canonical books--in contrast to (Eerdman's statement of) the
fourth century views.

Edgar Pearlstein asks (Fri 7 May 1993) whether the Supreme Court, or
any other government authority, has attempted a legal definition of
religion.

The Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1958 exempted
from the draft those whose ""religious training and belief"" was
opposed to participation in war in any form. It defined ""R T & B"" as
""an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving
duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but [not
including] essentially political, sociological, or philosophical
views or a merely personal moral code.""

In the 1965 case of UNITED STATES V. SEEGER, the Supreme Court
broadened the definition so as not to restrict it to explicit
theists. Justice Tom Clark, delivering the Court's opinion, said:

   We have concluded that Congress, in using the expression ""Supreme
   Being"" rather than the designation ""God,"" .... the test of belief
   ""in a relation to a Superme Being"" is whether a given belief that
   is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its
   possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God
   of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption. Where such
   beliefs have parallel positions in the lives of their respective
   holders we cannot say that one is ""in a relation to a Supreme

afford something in the 14k-16k range.  i am interested in the SUV's
but am not sure there are any that are decent which i can afford.
i think the ford explorer got good reviews from consumer reports but
is above my $$$ range.  the isuzu rodeo is probably in my price range
but i think consumer reports gave it a big thumbs down.  can anyone
offer any suggestions?  i am hoping for something a little more hip
than the traditional wagon, and the SUVs look like fun (we do a lot of

Dave - you might like to read a book by Florence Bulle ""God
Wants You Rich & Other Enticing Doctrines"", which discusses
OOBEs in one of her chapters.

In the Bible we have examples of men caught up in the Spirit (eg
Ezekiel, Paul). I believe that also this experience is
counterfeited by Satan - so that for example yoga and other
eastern medatitive techniques can be used to induce the soul to
leave the body and float off. Someone tried to sell me a book in
Los Angeles airport entitled ""Easy Journeys to Other Planets""
which uses such techniques.

The occultic trance of a medium sometimes involves such body
departure - the book ""The Challanging Counterfeit"", about a
former medium who gets saved, tells how the author, on his last
trance, was attacked by evil spirits who tried to kill him
while returning to his body at the end of the seance
because of his interest in Christianity and how he was supernaturally
protected by the Lord.

There may be some similarities in mind-altering drugs and the
phenomena of 'tripping'.

As regards the connection between body and soul, there is an
interesting verse in Ecclesiastes. In a passage talking about
old age, the preacher writes ""Then man goes to his eternal home
and mourners go about the streets. Remember Him--before the
silver cord is severed."" (12.5-6) My understanding of this
silver cord is that it is something that attaches body and soul
in a manner somewhat similar to an umbilical cord or an
astronaut's air-line to his spaceship.
When a person goes out of body this silver cord still attaches
the soul whereever it goes - and is vulnerable to being broken:
astral projection can be dangerous! Bulle, I think, reports a
case of a yogi off on an OOBE who was found dead in his
apartment, with no apparent external cause.

                      Genoa Presents High Performance 
                        Video Graphics Accelerator

        SAN JOSE, Calif USA -- Genoa Systems Corporation announces 
WINDOWSVGA 24,  a True Color 24-bit graphics accelerator card that 
delivers up to 16.8 million colors at speeds faster than the 
competition.  Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high 
refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  
The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local 
bus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).
        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers 
maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate 
of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 
non-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater 
than standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video 
standards.
        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology, 
which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more 
comfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility 
developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen 
and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.
        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed 
offered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards 
will only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will 
transfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is 
also offering this card in the ""TurboBahn"" combination packaged 
with their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.
        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, 
WINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance 
value.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to ""turbocharge"" 
the chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with 
power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced 
chip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and 
reliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D 
Studio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins 
are available on Genoa's BBS at (408) 943-1231.
        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of 
graphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for 
IBM-compatible personal computers.  All products come with a two 
year limited warranty on parts and labor.  Genoa products are 
currently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors, 
resellers, VARs and systems integrators.

First, I'm sorry to hear that you have had to see your grandmother go

There are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderly
adults.  The change in environment can cause problems.  Anesthetic agents
can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of
the body as easily.  In addition, medications and interactions between
medications can cause confusion.

the drug has been discontinued, I do not know.  I have not _seen_ anything
to that effect.  However, I also had not been looking for that information.

I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do is
the following;

From a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each having
it's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  Given the
listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the
listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  This
means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's
incoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is
possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles
relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given
angle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the
source.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source
changes position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some
reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined
could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation
simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.  

Have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system? 

Please post or mail any answers or comments.

>Does anyone now where an English translation of the long recension of
>the Acts of the Apostles can be found?

1] An english translation of this can be found in:
   ""The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an
   introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance"", J. M. Wilson
   (London, 1923).

2] Another work that might be useful is:
   ""The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and
   Notes on Selected Passages"", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;
   reprinted 1970).

(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the
text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it
actually contains an english translation or not.)

3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:
   ""The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in
   Acts"", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).

4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the
early '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)

5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if
you're interested in examining the differences in the long recension
an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:
   ""A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT"", Bruce Metzger (United Bible
   Society, 1971).

Metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of
the Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went
behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in
the UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are
included in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).

In particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:
   ""[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full
   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and
   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...
   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the
   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the
   evidence that supports the divergent readings."" (p 272).

>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has
>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the
>differences are between the long and the short forms.

6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the
ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter
(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is
usually called the ""Western"" version and its main witness is the Codex
Bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).

7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition
(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the
text edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains
18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.

8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations
in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main
difference seems to ""expansion"" of detail in the Western text (or, if
you prefer ""contractions"" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems
to be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific
cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.

9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the
more authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything
approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents
purely the ""authentic"" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be
examined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the
Alexandrian text is the ""better"" more often than not.

Subject: QuickTime performance (was Re: Rumours about 3DO ???)
Organization: University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand
Lines: 67

OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,
the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a
version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).
I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results
(for better or for worse).

I pulled out a copy of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that I had recorded off TV
a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where
the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized
a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space
station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only
5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.

I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot
card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then
imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,
keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled
to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default
""2.00"" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten
frames.

I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used
for the results I'd been reporting earlier.

Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.

That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short
test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard
disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate
was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk
(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.

I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240
size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who
observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in
action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's
entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...

Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.

The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with
""preferred"" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played
from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).
A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was
very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with
ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this
much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task
switching.

A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see
any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight
stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.

I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also
improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance
even more...

Saturns sold in my area (Anne Arundel County, MD).  He has an SC with the
Viper voice alarm installed.  The alarm does everything, turn on the car, 
the radio, the heater, roll down windows, unlock the doors...  The alarm goes
off more frequently on hot days when a person walks by.  It gets sensitive up
to about 5 feet in 85degree heat.  It isn't as bad as convetional siren alarms,
because it doesn't continue to wail, it just says ""Protected by Viper, please

You are right, Michael.

In John 3:5, Jesus says, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, no one can enter the

He said, and He meant it.  That verse is the definition of baptism.  I don't

Recently I've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon
cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.  In
particular, Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book ""Colon Cleansing for
Health and Longevity"" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very
similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics,
along with certain orally ingested ""debris-loosening agents"", boosts
the immune system to a significant degree.

He also plugs a unique appliance called the ""Colema Board"", which
facilitates the self-administration of colonics.  It sells for over
$100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Tox
products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash,
supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its
bulkiness.

If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its
particulars, or the Colema Board and related products, I'd be very
interested to hear about research and personal experience.

This article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches upon
fasting and cleansing through a ""ritual"" system of purification.

According to the literature, it will do quadruple buffering so that you

For the information of those not ""lucky"" enough to live in the city of
Austin, TX, if an auto a/c system is checked and found to have leaks,
it must be repaired at that time, or evacuated.  This is an ordinance
unique (I think) to the city of Austin.

Freon is subject to increasing taxes, but $12 is about 2X cost here.
Recovered freon is not required to be ""purchased"" from the car it is
withdrawn from.  As a matter of practice, some shops here are charging 
a recycling fee that is less than the cost of the freon removed if it 
is reintroduced to the system.

Just another quality service from an _Enviornmentally Conscious_ city.

This is a very simplistic view of safety. Assuming that you are in a collision
(less likely with a more agile smaller car), then the important factor
is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you. This is why a thousand
pound F1 car can hit a wall at 200 and the driver walks out and why
everybody dies when a Suburban hits a wall at 35 (as I recall for the last
generation Suburban HIC numbers). 

As an aside, just what is the point of an airbag? It seems to me that
seatbelts with pretensioners (Audi et al), or a good tight 5 point belt 
will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag. You might be

saved from some flyign glass? Or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator
safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are
wearing no seat belt?

""traction control"" as far as the optional feature that one buys with

a torque sensing differential is a type of LSD, but not all LSD's
are torque sensing.  viscous coupled differentials (as opposed to
viscous couplings) are rotational sensing, not torque sensing.
for that matter, so are ""traction control"" systems that use ABS

A good reason (which is why many companies use it) for 48 bits / pixel
is so you can use double buffering (for animating scenes) - i.e. you have
2 * 24-bit planes. You write to the one in the background, and then FLIP! 
-- the entire screen updates to the second image-plane. The screen updates 
in one refresh and you don't see different objects appearing in the order

The best thing to do is leave it, it will work its own way out to the surface.
Anything you stick up there to try and clean it is just going to push the wax

Well, that post was not that accurate.  People with early life hernias
are felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias.
The hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining.  
However, the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is 
high enough that it ought to be repaired.  The risk of cancer is probably
no higher than the general population, but since you are near 40, it would
be sensible to have some sort of cancer screening, such as a flexible
sigmoidoscopy.  Sorry for the misleading info.

	What's sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how much
it has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendor's
hardware.  I currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors - Apple,
DEC, and SGI - and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendor's
hardware.  Currently, it seems like SGI customers are pissed at SGI about
dropping support for the Personal Iris, DEC customers are pissed at DEC for
dropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes, and Apple customers
seem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced that's faster and
cheaper than the one they just bought.  When I used to be a Sun customer
years ago, I remember people being pissed at Sun for leaving their 386
and 680x0 customers out in the cold when Sparc came along.

	What's really interesting is that from what I can tell, the MIS
folks in the basement with their ES/9000 don't seem to be pissed at IBM.
Why?  I have no idea.  Either IBM really does take care of their customers
better, or they just have their customers brainwashed better than the
smaller vendors do.

Damn straight! As far as I've heard, unless the owner is _very_
hard up, the GT-40s are not for sale at any price that mere
mortals could afford.

>And maybe the Mustang

I think the GT-40 actually _is_ street legal, although that particular
question is moot (see the price figures below).

>This car was right hand drive (weren't they all like that?). How much does
>a GT-40 go for? How many were made?

I wish I could find my Shelby-American guide; it included the GT-40
registry (as of '88 or so). There were precious few of them made 
(fifty is the number that springs to mind; they made just enough
to qualify for the Manufacturer's Cup, or whichever series it
was that Shelby broke Ferarri's 13-year winning streak in in '65),
and they are all accounted for. The last price I saw estimated on a
GT-40 was a little bit over $1,000,000 (yes, that's right, ONE MILLION
US DOLLARS; it was second only to some worthless piece of Ferrari
that it would blow the doors off of ;-).

I don't recall off-hand what the drive configuration was, although
I'm certain some must have been LHD, as they had to be sold to qualify
for racing. The drivertrain was the Ford 427 (hi-riser, I think, 
and/or side-oiler) coupled to various 4-speed transmissions. They
also used 3-speed manuals; they had lots of problems with the
original trannys breaking under the load of the 427. Layout was
rear-engine, rear-drive, with the ""bundle of snakes"" exhaust
headers...I can remeber other bits and pieces of info, but I
can't remember whether they applied to the GT-40 or the Shelby
Cobra Daytona Coupe...I'll try and find that reference.

the abdomen of a young woman standing nearby.  Later,  when she (a young
woman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier did
the honorable thing of marrying her.  According to this story, they lived
happily ever after.  
Perhaps the most famous of Mr. Rau's classes was the time he would come

what this is?  It's a medical instrument called a 'cock reamer' and it's
used to unclog your penis when you have VD.  They just ram it up there
without an anesthetic!""  Needless to say this had a chilling effect.
I didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour.  Later in life

Yes, let do.  Try: 

""And if anyone causes one of these little ones *who believes in me*
to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea
with a large millstone tied around his neck.""  Mark 9:42

""Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them,
for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.  I tell you
the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God
like a little child will never enter it.""

The Colossians passage does not make faith a requirement
for baptism.  It merely says that in baptism we are born again,
regenerated, and resurrected through faith.  In the case
of an infant I would say that baptism works faith in the
heart of the infant--through the power of the word.

The Colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision.
Circumcision was the means by which a male infant was made
a part of God's covenant with Israel.  It was commanded to be
performed on the eighth day.  The early church understood this,
and even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the
eighth day, or if it could in fact be done earlier.

Aaron> Romans 10:16-17 ""But not all the Israelites accepted the good
Aaron> news.  For Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'
Aaron> Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the
Aaron> message is heard through the word of Christ.""

Aaron> So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the
Aaron> message of the gospel.  

And the gospel is surely preached at any infant's (or adult's)
baptism.  Indeed, in a very real sense, the sacraments are
the Gospel made tangible.

Aaron> God's word preached.  Kids are not yet spiritually,
Aaron> intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to respond to

How do you know they are not yet mature enough to have faith?
Do you know this on the basis of God's Word, or from your own
reason?

Faith is also described as a gift from God, Ephesians 2:8,9. 
He gives faith to infants just as he gives it to adults, through
the power of the gospel, Romans 1:6.

Aaron> If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't
Aaron> hold us guilty for anyone else's sins.  So we can have no
Aaron> original guilt from Adam.

Here you show that you just don't understand original sin--
you are arguing against a straw man.
Maybe you've been talking to Catholics too much.  I don't
know.  But original sin does not consist of God's imputation
of Adam's guilt to us.  It consists of our inheritance of
Adam's sinful nature.  It is actual sin.  See for example,
the Augsburg Confession, Article II, and the Apology of the
Augsburg Confession, Article II, and, for extra credit,
John Knox's `The Scots confession', Article III.

Aaron> Now then that we have a little more background as to why

Aaron> Romans 5:12 ""Therefore, just as sin entered the world through
Aaron> one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to
Aaron> all men, because all sinned--""


Ask yourself this question.  ""Do infants ever die?""  Then ask
yourself, ""If infant baptism is not valid, then where was the
Christian Church during all the centuries when almost all 
of the baptisms were performed on infants?  Were Luther, Melancthon,
Calvin, Zwingli, Hus, Knox, Andrae, and Chemnitz Christians?

Who are you to say what is literal and what is not?  Is a literal
interpretation manifestly absurd in Psalm 51 by reason of direct
contradiction with a clear passage from the Word of God?

You might also compare Genesis 8:21, ""The LORD smelled the
pleasing aroma and said in his heart, `Never again will I curse
the ground because of man, even though every inclination of
his heart is evil from childhood....""

Aaron> We see
Aaron> that he did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The

You are a long way from proving this (rather monstrous) assertion.
All you can say is that Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature.  A
conclusion that he did wrong as a child is based on an extrapolation
of reason, not on a direct revelation in Scripture.

This was a popular belief in the Judaism of Jesus` time, that Elijah
would return again (as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and
did not actually die).  However Jesus was referring to John the
Baptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John
(remember Elijah didn`t die) but that John was a similar prophet to
Elijah.  John was a fiery preacher, he wore sackcloth and wandered
rough through Israel preaching the coming kingdom.  The verses that
describe him (in Mark`s gospel) can be linked to OT references about
Elijah.  Hence John was similar to Elijah and Jesus was drawing the
parallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the Suffering
Servant in Isaiah (and other messianic figures) and himself.

A brief reply but I don`t have time to look up all the relevant stuff.

Suffice to say there is a very strong explanation.

The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with
the newer Ca. emissions laws involves three things I know of:

1. All compliant diesels are turbocharged.
2. All use an ""aftercooler"", which cools the air which was heated
   by compression by the turbocharger (up to about 25 PSI).
3. A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air
   intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is
   low.

No scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used.  The path from
the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free.

Interestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output 
and mileage are enhanced by these measures.  One can buy aftermarket
turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power,
and these are approved by the CARB.

Well, Michael,  I don't know if clh has left them in the faq  (Maybe you should
post the ""how to get there map again), but I posted two or three lengthy
exegetical paper on these verses.  They looked at the OT, NT and
intertestimental usages of terms in reference.  I would suggest you read those
before you talk about a ""need"" in exegetical studies.  If those aren't enough,
I could also provide ""The source and NT Meaning of Apsevokoitai"".  Dr James
DeYoung published it in THE MASTERS SEMINARY JOURNAL in fall of '92.  To read
any of these 4 papers shows that the shoe is on the other foot as far as a need
for honest exegesis.

Again, please refer to the faq file, or if you are unable to acess it, drop me
a line and I will enclose them to you.

This is almost certainly a MacBinary file which is an encoded version
of a mac file so the Resource fork and Data fork get preserved.
You need a program that converts this to a regular file. If this is a
macbinary file, you may have downloaded it in Text mode and is probably
corrupt (if you did). If you're using FTP to transfer it at any point make sure
you type ""binary"" first.

If you can open the file with a text editor and find

at the top, it is a BinHex file and can be decoded with
BinHex 4.0 (among other programs).

Ouch, this is a good question. To me, not existing is worse
than existing no matter what, so I will modify this question to be:
would I be a Christian if it made no eternal difference in my
reward or punishment? I hope this is in the same spirit you want.

I personally am very goal oriented. It is hard for me to do things
that do not achieve some goal. However, to relate this to sports, 
only after I learned to not care about the score did I become
a good basketball player. I had to learn to go all out no matter
the situation. Perhaps this lesson is relevent. After all,
only if I can give up my life can I keep it, only if I am
humble can I achieve glory. Only if I concentrate on living
my life now the best I can will I be afforded life eternal.
I think you have illuminated the true meaning of ""saved by faith.""

But what is my answer? Right now I would remain a Christian.
However, was that always my answer? That's the problem. Heaven
and hell are good motivators at certain stages of maturity.
And I admit there are certain times when perhaps I bite my
tongue and put up with something in the hope of a better day,
i.e. I mentally trade present happiness for future happiness.
I hope the cynics and skeptics do not read more into that
than appropriate, but I am trying to be honest.

I think these kinds of questions are extremely fruitful. I guess it
depends on how one views knowledge and learning. By stripping
ideas to simple, straightforward, opposing concepts we can
determine levels of importance. By analyzing the theoretically 
absurd we can gain a better understanding of the actually absurd.

Umm, weren't you the one objecting to someone who is a ""licensed

Actually, I almost never use the term quack.  When I discuss
""systemic yeast syndrome"", however, I always point out that
mainstream medicine views this as a quack diagnosis (and I agree
with that characterization).

Subject: Raytracing Colours?
Keywords: raytracer colours realism vectors
Organization: Computer Science Department, University of Cape Town
Lines: 25

I have a question about recursive, backward raytracing.

When an incident ray (I) strikes an object at point P, first
the normal (N) is calculated. Light rays are calculated (L1 to Ln 
where n is the number of light sources) - these being the light
rays that do not intersect with anything. The reflected ray (R) and
the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.

Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours 
along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol. Each object has its own
colour oCol and each light source has liCol (1 <= i <= n).

The question is: 
  How do you combine rCol, tCol, oCol and all the liCol's to get
  the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray?

All colours are defined as strucures (records) having r, g, b components
between 0 and 1.

If anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints?

As to the last comment, I certainly realize that it was not intended to
sound that way.  I am still trying to understand *how* a spiritual being
colud truly be one and three at the same time.  All of the descriptions
of this are either Platonic or sound like special pleading (sort of,
""they appear to be three seperate beings in all ways, but really they are
one, trust me"").

Neither of these is acceptible to me.

The fact is, so far the only descriptions of the trinity that makes any
*sense* to me are the modalistic ones, such as Modalistic Monarchianism
or ""Economic Trinitarianism"".  [I can accept that the three aspects are
intrinsic to the nature of God, so I perhaps lean more towards the latter].

I am trying, here, to see if anybody can come up with another description
that is both orthodox and believable.

physical separation.  All three Persons are omnipresent, so they are

different aspects, modes, or whatever, of one God.  If you accept

I've mentioned this study a couple of times now: Ingestion of yogurt
containing Lactobacillus acidophilus as prophylaxis for candidal
vaginitis, Annals of Internal Medicine, 3/1/92 116(5):353-7.  Do you
have a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather than
capsules of lactobacillus (even though it had positive results)?

The study was a crossover trial of daily ingestion of 8 ounces of
yogurt.  There was a marked decrease in infections while women were
ingesting the yogurt.  Problems with the study included very small
numbers (33 patients enrolled) and many protocol violations (only
21 patients were analyzed).  Still, the difference in rates of infection
between the two groups was so large that the study remains fairly
believable.

SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL
 
    By Laura Pitter
    TUZLA, Bosnia, Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist
when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim
town of Srebrenica last August.
    But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody
war, he considers himself a surgeon.
    ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no
license to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives
normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''
    Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla,
the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of
the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the
suffering of the thousands trapped there.
    ``I lived through hell together with the people of
Srebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest
heroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.
    Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant
at a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he
had never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says
he has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for
guidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without
anesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean
sections.
    He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the
first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000
patients.
    He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from
Tuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people
carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him
through guerrilla terrain, he said.
    His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells
landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football
field, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of
the dead were women and children.
    The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the
children were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the
blood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.
    ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not
piece them together. One woman holding her two children in her
hands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no
heads.''
    Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were
deplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had
the hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.
    The six general practitioners who had been operating before
he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They
didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''
    Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by
mid-September he had run out of supplies.
    ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes
they were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no
anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain
because it increased bleeding.
    ``People were completely conscious during amputations and
stomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were
impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.
    ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.
    The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived
from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.
    But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in
mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the
region. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''
    Then the hunger set in.
    Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began
air dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day
from complications associated with malnutrition, he said.
    ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the
people from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.
    According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in
Srebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.
    Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after
visiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.
    ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of
people standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when
I left. And I cried too.''

I'm still looking for Fractint drivers or a new release which supports the
 24bit color mode of the Diamond Speedstar 24X.  There are some 2, 4 and 26
 million colros drivers, but none work with the 24X.  

Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks!

Hello again.

Anyone here done any tinting work.  What are the best brands out there?
How about applications...I heard there was a water based brand that s
you can move around, till it's just right, and you then let it dry like that.

Also I would consider having it professionally done, how much around
Wisconsin or Chcago area, that does a decent job, fairly cheap. (college kid)

Thanks for all the info...

Ps.  What is the maximum legal tint limit.

What is fornication? (sex outside of marriage, abuse of sex)  

Is not homosexual intercourse outside the context of marriage?
Isn't it an unatural use of what God has given us?

Why is it that homosexuals are using the Grace of God as a license to
practice sin? 

   For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long
   beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who
   turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only 
   Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

                                      Jude 4 (NASB)

What is defined by God as a legitimate marriage?

   For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and
   shall cleave to his wife; and the shall become one flesh.

                                      Gen 2:24 (NASB)

   And He answer and said, ""Have you not read, that He who created them
   from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE, and said, 'FOR THIS 
   CAUSE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER, AND CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE;
   AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'?  Consequently they are no longer
   two, but one flesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no
   man separate."" 

                                      Matt 19:4-6 (NASB)

   But because of immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let
   each woman have her own husband.  Let the husband fulfill his duty
   to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.

                                      1 Corinthians 7:4,5 (NASB)

I disagree... Every law that is written in Leviticus should be looked at 
as sin.  That is why we have a need for a savior.  I can understand 
someone who may not know a particular sin listed in the Levitcal law, but
I would hope that they would repent when confronted with it.

Also I noticed that the preceeding verses say.  

   Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her
   menstrual impurity.  And you shall not have intercourse with your
   neighbors wife, to be defiled with her. 


                                   Leviticus 18:19, 20 (NASB)

These verses are just as relevant as:

   You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an
   abomination.

                                   Leviticus 18:22 (NASB)

Why was God telling the Israelites not to practice such things?

   Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these
   the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled.
   For the land has become defiled, therefore I have visited its 
   punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants.
   But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and Judgments, and 
   shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native, nor
   the alien who sojourns among you

                                    Leviticus 18:24-26 (NASB)

He is the Lord...  Listen to what he has to say... 

Nobody wants to dismiss homosexuals.  We do love you, but we don't 
agree that what you practice is not sin.  You have not truly repented
of your sin.  We hate the sin that is within your lives.  I hate sin
that is in my life.  All Christians should hate the sin that is within
their own lives.  Confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance. 
Yes I agree with John 3:17, but I also know that Jesus said, ""Repent for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand""  Matt 3:17.  If you don't agree that
homosexuality is sin than how can you repent from it?  This means that
you remain in bondage to it.  Repent from it and God will set you free.

In His Love, 

       Mike

Try another dealer.  Sometimes the sophistication of equipment etc is
better at one dealer than another.  You may also find another dealer
willing to help you with the problem.

Hi there, maybe you can help me...

I have an '88 Corolla with a 5 speed as the subject line says.  The gearbox
seems excessivly clunky.  I used to have an '85 Corolla, and it was also 
somewhat clunky, but it had 30,000 more miles on it, and it wasn't nearly as
bad as this car!  Is there fluid in the 5speed case?  If there is, could it
just be low, or in need of a change?  As I recall, only the autos have fluid.
Or am I just mistaken?  Please no flames for owning an import.  I also have
an old Dodge, but it's not in very good shape these days...

Paul's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not
a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past, just as the fate of the
man born blind (John 9) was not.  There is no question here of the
simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner
of one's destiny.  Even the eastern traditions, or many of them,
do not say that, as one knowledgeable poster pointed out.

And if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation
does not say anything one way or another about it.  Even John the Baptist,
who Jesus says emphatically is Elijah (Matt 11:14), does not appear to 
have been aware of it, at least at the point at which he was asked. But 
it is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether 
he is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or Elijah, is emphatic in 
the first case and very weak in the third.

I would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the
different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated
earth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important in our
time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of
Christianity and Christian doctrine.  For the most part, those who do
accept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if they
are Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure.
I believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring
to bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianity
takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth
lives. It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed 
in this newsgroup in particular.

I have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth lives
largely from the work of Rudolf Steiner.  Not that I hold him as an
authority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light
of these ideas.  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar-
nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later
times, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first
two millenia after Christ's deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes 
important that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our 
understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the 
significance of this idea.  For the discussions in this newsgroup, I 
have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible 
to scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.

My opinion(for what it's worth) is that 40 x-rays is *way* too many.  
Guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-rays 
that one should have over a given period of time because of all the 
environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans, ionizing radiation 
is one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical 
formation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus 
in the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors 
in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may 
be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care 
to comment?).

Most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones, 
I don't think that there are many drugs that can help ""dissolve"" the 
kidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium 
have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the 
aterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could 
speed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that 
a diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery 
is being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second 
opinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break 
up the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's are 
notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.  
My condolences to your friend.

I read a great book about eye dominance several years ago. So there is one
book out there..at least one :).

There were several types of eye dominance. Where a person looks in their
memory usually indicates a type of eye dominanc Another type is related to
coordination activities like hitting a ball. Another for reading. 

I didn't read one that discussed prescription strength. Although people
with bad vision, near or far sighted would tend to depend on the stronger
eye.

Since this was posted on comp.ai, I assume there is an AI angle to this.  Hacking is
what AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g.
thesis research & write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly,
etc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it.
Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that
not many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.

In addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing
running programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to
problem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs.
At a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should
'Get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas -
and I have to say I'm inclined to agree.

(I don't claim to be a superhacker, but I don't think that invalidates my remarks.
And I'm sure this isn't the whole story.)

Hello,
I have some problem in converting tga file(generated by POVray) to
rle file. When I convert, I do not get any warning message. But
if I use xloadimage/getx11, something is wrong.

Error messages are,
% targatorle -o o.rle data.tga
% xloadimage o.rle
o.rle is a 0x0 24 bit RLE image with no map (will dither to 8 bits), with gamma of 1.00
  Dithering image...done
  Building XImage...done
xloadimage: X Error: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation) on 0x0
xloadimage: X Error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) on 0xb00003
......

I know that I need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm, but I do not spend
time to install them. Even I do not want to generate .rgb from POVray
and then convert them to rle, if possible.(.rgb to rle works, but
it will mess up my directory with so many files, and it needs 2 more
steps to finally convert to rle file. say cat | rawtorle | rleflip )
Does any body out there have same experience/problems ?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: What _do_ we feel?
Lines: 35

I see a parallel between what I will stupidly call the ""homosexual"" 
issue and the ""atheist"" issue. Please take no offense at these
comparisons.

The homosexual ""feels"" things that I admit I do not ""feel"". 
He learns that these feelings are classified as homosexual feelings
and learns of a model of sexuality that seems to apply to
his feelings, which he then can fit with his experiences.
That is, this model gives him a sense of understanding his
situation. Models that do not match up with what he knows he
feels will be discarded. However, one wonders if once accepting
the idea of his being gay and deciding what exactly that
means he will analyze all his feelings and experiences based on 
the definition he has already accepted, which of course validates
his model.

If that was hard to understand now listen to my parallel.

The Christian ""feels"" things that an atheist claims he does not
feel. The Christian accepts the Christian theology as the true
description of what his feelings mean. Once accepting this
model he interprets his experiences with regards to this model
which of course validates his Christianity.

As a reminder, I am a Christian, a Catholic, I don't hate 
homosexuals or atheists, but am just trying to understand
them. I only compare them because they are both so foreign
to me. Am I as blind to the homosexual as the atheist seems
blind to me? Or am I as prejudiced against atheistic denial of
religious experience as the homosexual is prejudiced against 
attempts by society to deny his sexuality?

Or am I just out to lunch, again?

There are several CRT-to-film writers around. Agfa has some, they also might

presentation slides or offers graphics services. They should have those

Gerry Palo wrote that there is nothing in Christianity that excludes
the theory of a succession of lives.

I wrote that the Apostle Paul, in Romans 9, speaks of God as
choosing Jacob over Esau, and adds that this is not as a result of
anything that either child had done, since they had not been born
yet.

Clearly, Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives, nor
does he suppose that his readers will believe it. For if they had
had previous lives, it would not make sense to say, ""Neither of them
has done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born.""

Daniel Cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for God to hate
Easau when Esau has done nothing bad?

I reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when
what is meant is simply putting in second place. As an example,
consider the saying in Matthew 6:24

 + No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one
 + and love the other, or....

Now, it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one
of them. But it is obviously true that he must put one of them in
second place. A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobby
calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call
simultaneously. It cannot give first priority to both. One must take
second place. In our original example, second place means that
Jacob, not Esau, is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and
obligation, and to be the ancestor of Christ.

Eugene Bigelow mentions Matthew 11:14 which says of John the
Baptist:

 + And if ye will receive it, this is ELijah, who was to come.

I take this to mean that John was an Elijah-like figure, dressing
and living like Elijah, preaching like Elijah, and fulfilling the
prediction that Elijah would prepare the way for the Messiah.  I do
not think that he was Elijah in a literal sense, and, appareently,
neither did he (John 1:21).

A whole $h!tload. Minivans, pickups, just about any car above the

I'm interested in this from the other angle: what antihistamine can I
take at bedtime for relief of allergies, with the assurance that its
sedative effect will have completely worn off by the next morning, but
preferably with the anti-allergy effect lasting longer?

I'm thinking mainly of OTC products. Which has the least duration of
sedative action: Benadryl, Chlor-Trimeton, or what?
Note that I'm asking about duration, not intensity.

I think you mean ARPA; AARP is the American Association of Retired Persons,
and I seriously doubt that they'd want young whippersnappers building
anything on their backbones, what with de-calcification and all :-)

>to identify the type of organisation.  Internet extended the convention for

The general convention is that if it doesn't have a country tag on it, it's
a US site. That includes:
	.com	commercial 
	.edu	educational 
	.mil	US Military sites 
	.gov	US Gov't non-military sites (eg NASA sites)
	.org	anyone who is ""none of the above""
There are sites with such tags that are non-US sites, but they will have
the country extension (eg xxxx.edu.au is an extension I saw today).
US sites can also use the .us extension, but, as Mr. Smith pointed 
out, the Internet was built on the ARPANet backbone, and they default
to US sites if there's no country code.

I would suggest that anyone who didn't know this (or wants to know
more about it on a non-system-administrative level) check out
the book _The_Whole_Internet_User's_Guide_and_Catalog_ by Ed Krol.
(or is it Catalog and User's Guide? I can never remember, and my copy
is my desk at home...). It's a very good not-necessarily-technical
guide to the Internet and the various utilities that lurk on it (including
USENET). I don't think it's part of the Nutshell series, but it is
published by O'Reilly and Associates.

This should go to one of the news.* newsgroups, but damned if I
can figure out which one.... :-)

DON'T BUY IT!  All of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches
later on.  ALso it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably
know BMW's are not cheap to fix either.  The owner sounds like a shady
character just trying to take advantage of someone. Sure $ 3000 sounds good
but you should calculate how much the repairs will be. It sounds like you
would have to sink in at least $ 1000 to get everything fixed if not more.
Also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned. Who knows how many
miles are on it and how it was driven.  Sure people tell you BMW's hold up but
you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear. For all you know it
could have 200,000 miles on it.  The thing you have to remember is that this
isn't the last 528i around either. Just wait and keep shopping. For around $
5000-6000 you can probably find one that is better, needs less repair, and has
legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering. Take it from a guy who
has been taken a couple of times. Good luck.

I'd prefer a unix program, but Dos is fine also.

I've seen Alchemy (for DOS) and some windows image viewers which can save

Any help would be apprieciated!

Geico supports (reads gives to police) Laser Radars.  They have been known 
to be very picky.  No sports cars. No radar detectors (although Maryland 
insurance board over rules this consistantly). No turbos.

Basically it seems if you need to use your insurance ever they don't want 
you.  They once told me they wouldn't insure me (perfect record) because of 
my corvette even though it would be insured by another specialty insurance. 
 ""We must insure all the cars"".  I think this rep didn't know what she was 
talking about.

Geico is cheap.  But if you ever file a claim be prepared to be dropped.  I 
think in most areas two tickets will do it.

Geico will never see a dime from me If I can help it.

State Farm.  Slighty higher than most but very good response.  Not as picky 
as Geico.

This sounds to me like a sort of generic modalism (in the the three phases
of water are but different modes of behavior of the same physical stuff).
It certainly does not seem to me to describe the orthodox position.

[Of course, I suppose that the medieval view of water may have been
different, but now we know that the phases of water are just different
*behaviors* of the same physical stuff - different modes, not different
identities - but perhaps the medieval people did not know that].

This is clearly Modalistic Monarchianism, since these three aspects depend
solely on point of view, and are do not really represent actual variety
within the person.

I have posted DISP140.ZIP to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.
I will upload this package to SIMTEL20 later.

******   You may distribute this program freely for non-commercial use
         if no fee is gained.
******   There is no warranty. The author is not responsible for any
         damage caused by this program.

Important changes since Version 1.35:
  Added support for IRIS.
  Support Mix/Concat. two images.
  Added support for 'batch conversion'.
  Added support for 'load/save palette table'.
  Added support for 'edge enhance'.
  Added support for 'crop one line'.
  Added support for 'negate image'.
  New color quantization option.
  Fix some minor bugs.

(1) Introduction:
  This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different
  formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)
  on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different
  formts.
  Include simple file management system.
  Support 'slide show'.
+ Support 'batch conversion'.
  There is NO LIMIT on image size.
  Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.
  If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.
  If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).


(2) Hardware Requirement:
  PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.
  min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).
  (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).
  Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).

  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.

  Supported Wares:

  * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)
  * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping
  * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768
  * 80387
  * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies
  * VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX

  Unsupported:

  * DPMI
  * Microsoft Windows

  Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory
  model, SVGA graphics.


(3) Installation:
  Video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP.
  (If you use Western Digital VGA chips, read readme.wd)
  (This GO32.EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible
   with original version)
  *** But some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with
      other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem,
      DON'T put go32.exe within search path.

  *** Please read runme.bat for how to run this program.

  If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment
    GO32.

  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256

  If you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment GO32.

  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387

  **** Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn.
                 Other drivers are not tested.
              2. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits
                 display. You don't need to use vesa driver.
                 If et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn.
              3. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display,
                 please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).

Subject: Ten Commandments or Ten Discourses?
Lines: 135

In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks, 
I came across something that was completely new to me, 
and I thought I'd offer it for comment.

To keep this as brief as possible, let me state my 
observation as a declarative statement, and then whoever 
wants to can comment on it.  Basically, what I think 
I've observed is that the phrase ""the Ten Commandments"", 
as used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but 
rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex. 
20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase ""the Ten 
Commandments"" should more accurately be translated ""the 
Ten Discourses"", of which the passage we call the ""Ten 
Commandments"" is really only the first.

I'm not completely convinced that the above is true, but 
for purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I 
was sure.

Arguments supporting the above idea:

1)  There aren't really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.  
In order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of 
them out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not 
support such a division because they are all about not 
worshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to 
have no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship 
the idols mentioned in verse 4.  You can't violate 
verses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that 
the whole passage is one command, and leaving us with 
only Nine ""Commandments"".  I could go on at length about 
this, but for now I'll just stop with this summary.

2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning
of the traditional ""Ten Commandments"") and Ex 31:18 
(where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the 
Ten Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break 
these ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; 
25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; 
31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these 
passages begins with some variation of the phrase, ""And 
the LORD spoke to Moses, saying...""  The exception is 
Ex. 21:1, which begins ""Now these are the ordinances 
which you are to set before them...""

3)  The word translated ""commandments"" in the phrase 
""the Ten Commandments"" isn't really the word for 
""commandment"", its the word for a speech, or an 
utterance.  It's a word often used for longer discourses 
rather than individual statements; for instance, when 
combined with the word 'yom' (day), this word is 
translated ""Chronicles"" in such phrases as ""now the rest 
of the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the 
Chronicles of x?...""  The word for ""commandment"" is 
freely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps 
it is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X's, 
he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and 
chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer 
than just a single command.

4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the 
stone tablets ""with the law and the commandments"" (Ex 
24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He 
has finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the 
Ten Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not 
immediately clear why God would wait several days and 
nine more discourses before giving these tablets to 
Moses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses 
written on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that 
God would not give Moses the tablets until He had 
finished delivering all Ten Discourses.

5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both 
tablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If 
these Ten ""Commandments"" were only the first 17 verses 
of Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE 
letters!  Not that He couldn't have, of course, but it 
does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to 
two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal-
sized letters.

6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out 
the ""commandments written on stone"" as being the 
""ministry of death"", ""that which is fading away,"" and 
""the ministry of condemnation.""  With the possible 
exception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is 
difficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in 
Ex. 20:1-17 as being temporary, ""fading away""-type 
commandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone 
tablets should happen to have included all of the 
commandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31.

Arguments against this idea:

The main argument against this idea, aside from the fact 
that it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that 
in Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in 
Ex. 20:1-17, ""These words the LORD spoke...and He added 
no more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and 
gave them to me.""  This appears to identify the words 
just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone 
tablets.

That was my first impression, anyway.  However, after 
some thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how 
you understand the phrase ""These words.""  If Moses meant 
""These words *which I have just related to you* were 
spoken by God"" etc., then that would mean that only the 
traditional ""Ten Commandments"" were on the stone 
tablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical 
comment--""These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were 
spoken by God"" etc.--then that's quite different.

I did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of 
being given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the 
people asking Moses to represent them before God, 
whereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of 
Moses between the first and second discourses, several 
days BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This 
reinforces the idea that Moses' remarks in Dt 5:22ff 
were intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a 
strictly chronological account of when God wrote what, 
and at what point He stopped adding to what was on the 
tablets.

Summary:  all things considered, I find it somewhat more 
likely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only 
the first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses 
of God.  I don't know if anybody has ever espoused this 
idea before; it's brand-new to me.  So, while I lean 
towards accepting it, I would be very interested in 
hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to 
offer.

The Apocryphal books that are in the Septuagint were part of the canon 
used by the Greek-speaking churches from the inception of the church.
They were not added later (or much later).  This is a common misconception.

The preference of the Hebrew canon over the Greek canon is a later
innovation.   The church did not need to be guided to ""add"" the books
since they were part of the faith once received by the apostles and
passed to the Church.

The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang
and the consensus about what to believe in my ""car circle"" is that the 
suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current
Cobra, but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior.
After the MN12 (Thunderbird) cost and weight debacle, Ford decided 
independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won't be tried again in 
a volume car.  

The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years.  A version of
the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then.  Ford
is spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l V-6 engines which will
power most of their cars in the immediate future, and therefore probably
do not consider volume production of 300 hp V-8 engines a priority. 

Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new
Camaro/Firebird, IMO.  

I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will 
achieve with the Camaro/ Firebird.  The way GM loses money, the temptation
to ""just get them out the door"" for the sake of positive cash flow will be 
great once demand really takes off.

Subject: Need help: Z-buffering lines & areas together
Organization: Applicon, Inc.; Ann Arbor, MI (USA)
Keywords: Z-buffer, roundoff, lines, areas
Lines: 84

I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low
apparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 different
PEX implementations.  I can't find any discussion of this problem in any
resources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's
_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).

I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the
same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on
comp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,
hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and
are interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in
comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach
to dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above
Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)

The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize ""stitching""
artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are
coplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will
differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values
across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with
vertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether the
Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.
Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the
line is supposed to be solid.

Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly
different PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one
for the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-
mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in
effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The
result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to
attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.

This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used
in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair ""backwards"" (i.e.
smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view
table entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed
to NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than
if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.

I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount
to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,
typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).
Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC
between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix
the stitching.

But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003
to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Z
component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more
or less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the
Z-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one
problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines ""show through""
areas which they are supposed to lie behind.

I've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital
workstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test
program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;
this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX
5.1.

Open questions:
    (1) Why does this happen?
        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?
        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines
            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which
            could be corrected for?
        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their
            interpolators?
        --  Something else?
    (2) What to do about it?
        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision
            in Z-buffered HLHSR?
        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching
            artifacts?
        --  Am I just out of luck?

Any help would be immensely appreciated!

To avoid paperwork associated with re-certification as a brand new car,
etc. So for ad purposes it's a brand new nameplate, for paperwork it's
still a Stanza.

Yeah, People act really shocked about violence, as though it were new
to our species...

What about the holocaust? The crusades? The Salem witch trials? The
religious persecutions of the middle-ages? 

What about violent acts carried out in the name of religion all over
the world? What about the early Christians put to death by the Romans?
The Jews persecuted by Christians?

There are a lot more humans today than there have ever been. I do not
know the stats, but there are far more people on the planet than there
were 2 or 3 hundred years ago! The per capita acts of violence are
probably not significantly different than they were a hundred or a
thousand years ago!

There is nothing new about violence.

Yes, there are these two senses of interpretation, and certainly our
decision to accept Scripture as inspired ultimately rests on our own
private opinion.  However, when reading Scripture, we have to remember
that the Scriptures were given by God for our instruction, and that
the interpretation that matters is the one God intended.  For example,
if I decide that the fact that John the Baptist is Elijah teaches the
doctrine of reincarnation, I am wrong because that is not the intended
interpretation.  The prophets didn't make up this teaching; it came
from God, and we must accept it as such.  This necessarily means that
our private interpretations must take a back seat to the meaning God
intended to convey.  Certainly we must rely on our best efforts to
determine what this meaning is, but this very fact should make us
recognize that our private interpretations cannot be automatically
accepted as the infallible interpretation of God.  We need to test the
spirits to see if they are from God.  When the Holy Spirit speaks, he
says the same thing to all; he won't tell me that a passage means one
thing and tell you it means another.  If the two of us come to
conflicting conclusions, we can't both be completely right.  We know
our interpretations are reliable only when the Church as a whole
agrees on what Scripture means.  This is how we know the doctrines of
the Trinity, the dual nature of Christ, etc. infallibly.  These
matters are not up for private interpretation.

This is the reason Peter goes on to talk about the deceptiveness of
the false teachers.  They preferred their own private interpretation
to the God-given teaching of the apostles.  It is through such private
interpretation that the traditions of men, so soundly denounced in
Scripture, are started.

I've tried it, and so has one friend of mine.  No known side effects or
risks.  It didn't seem to work for us, but several studies now have 
suggested it does work for many people, so I think it's worth a try.

It's my understanding that Romans 9:13 ""As it is written, Jacob have I
loved, but Esau have I hated."" refers not to the two individuals, but
rather to their offspring, the tribe of Jacob and the tribe of Esau

See Obadiah, for example.  In fact, if you scan through the OT, you

Here is a press release from the U.S. Department of Energy.

 Energy Secretary Hails President's Plan For Alternative Fuel
Vehicles
 To: National Desk, Environment and Energy Reporters
 Contact: Larry Hart of the U.S. Department of Energy, 202-586-5806

   WASHINGTON, April 21  -- Secretary of Energy
Hazel R. O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order on
Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a ""driving force
behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative
fuel vehicles and fuel supplies.""
   President Clinton signed the order today, which calls for
federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the
next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for
in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
   President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner
Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to
advise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order.
   ""I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make
this happen,"" O'Leary said.  ""As Land Commissioner, Gary Mauro has
helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet
to alternative fuels, and has been a tireless proponent of natural
gas vehicles in speeches across the country.""
   The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending
a plan and schedule of implementation.
   ""The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead
by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a
practical, affordable choice for fleet owners across the country,""
O'Leary said.  ""Increased use of domestically-produced alternative
fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs.  We believe
that energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthy
economy are complimentary goals.""
   O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to
coordinate the agencies' five-year purchase plans, help with
funding for extra purchase or conversion costs, and work with GSA
to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make
fleet conversions practical.
   Under the order, the Department of Energy will also be working
with states, local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle
purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make
alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely
available.

Fine, but one of the points of this entire discussion is that ""we""
(conservative, reformed christians - this could start an argument...
But isn't this idea that homosexuality is ok fairly ""new"" [this
century] ? Is there any support for this being a viable viewpoint
before this century? I don't know.) don't believe that homosexuality
is ""acceptable to Him"". So your scripture quotation doesn't work for

I've been in two _major_ auto accidents, both were multiple car.  The worst
was a head-on three car collision (T intersection and one person ran a stop
sign).  In both cases I was stopped and had no place to go (and I saw it
coming both times).

If you _really_ want to add safety to _any_ car, simply add a cage to the
car.  They are available and cheap (about $500 in the USA).  Add to that
four or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions that
were otherwise not survivable.  but instead of people spending a little
extra money, we get legislation that says the gov't must mandate a minimal
level of protection for everyone. 

One other significant factor in improving one's own safety is to get some
training.  This will improve your safety more than any other single
investment will.  Drive/ride defensively (and that does not mean you have
to be a doddering old stick in the mud).  People here tend to enthuse about
autos more than the average (probably in the top 15th percentile in driving
ability), but still we sometimes overlook the obvious.  I've been to two
driving schools, and three riding schools for my motorcycle.  A very
worthwhile investment (and besides, it was a lot of fun too ;-). 

Safety is what you make of it, just because a carmaker doesn't provide you
with an adequate level of protection doesn't mean you have to leave it go at
that.

I too have had premature ventricular heartbeat, starting in 1974.  (These 
are not, by the way, ""extra"" heartbeats.  This is how they feel, and 
this is how I described them initially to the doctor, but they're 
actually *premature* heartbeats.  I would sometimes experience a lapse 
after one of these that went on for a suffocatingly long period of time, 
making me wonder if my heart were ever going to beat again.) 

I had them persistently for eighteen years.  Then I went on a low-fat 
diet, and they just stopped.  I haven't had a single episode of PVH 
for almost two years.  I know:  correlation does not imply causation. 
This is just FWIW.

	My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's
syndrome. Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome.

	This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for
hyperthyroidism. She'd been reluctant to have treatment for the
hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion
from it. 

	I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level
but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previous
endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered the
hospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions).

I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find an
abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. . 

I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia.

I'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel
to New York City. For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology.

Any information that might help. Apparently there hasn't been much
improvement in her condition over the past several months.

In the Hebrew of Genesis 3:15, the gender is clearly masculine.

The Latin has feminine forms, only by an accident of grammar.

Andrew stated that KECHARITOMENE means not just ""full of grace"" but
""having a plenitude or perfection of grace."" The word is used
elsewhere in the New Testament only in Ephesians 1:6

I cannot find any indication in my dictionary that the verb implies

You've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which
are used for chemotherapy.

The overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some of
these crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy
cancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different
effects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than
one drug at a time.

Some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle
of a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.

The first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis
and RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs.
The third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized 
aagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.

There are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis.
Others stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis.
At any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells
to stop growing.

If what you are seeking is ""practical"" advice, I apologize for rambling
on the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs
are rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to 
experience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small
frequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter
known as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines
tthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications 
can be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.

Probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always
happen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person 
themself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different
side effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug
headband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably
by reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on this
too, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib data.

I highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society.
They have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition,
if your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend ""Reach for Recovery"".
It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast 
because of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions.

If you have further questions, please send me E-mail.  I hav some good
access to information, and I enjoy trying to help other people.

I wish the best to you and your friend.

Only if you want to stop. Seriously though, every 2 years you should
have this done. Brake fluid absorbs water over time, the water becomes
steam when the fluid gets hot, and steam compresses. You'll also have
better luck with the longevity of master cylinder, calipers and brake
lines.

I hope someone can help me with the following problem - I'm sure there

Given a rectangle defined by

and a parallelogram defined by

-C1 <= a*x + b*y <= C1  and -C2 <= c*x + d*y <= C2

where C1, C2, a, b, c, d are constants and b/a != d/c (i.e. not
parallel lines)                                ^^
                                          not equal to

what is the area of their intersection?

   What I'm after is some general algorithm suitable for ALL rectangles

and examine each seperately e.g.

1) rectangle encloses parallelogram. 

2) parallelogram encloses rectangle.

3) two corners of parallelogram inside rectangle

If your Viper system were tuned like a neighbor's is you wouldn't get
any sleep because of the damn thing waking every one in the neighborhood
up.

We all used to try to ignore the alarm, but have now made a pact to
bombard the house with night-time visits and phone calls when ever we
are awakened because some thunder storm passed over the next county
or a stray dog looked at the car.

Car alarms are a serious pain-in-the-ass!

Playmation is available direct from Anjon & Associates for $299.  It's hard
to beat that price.  Also, you'd be better off with a newer version than
an older version that had bugs that have long since been clobbered.

Perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic
depression, or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get
depressed, but I know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the
thyroid that would cause depression. Note that weight gain is usually
a symptom of both. Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid
condition is present.

I don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output,
but I would tend to doubt it. As far as I know clinical depression is
caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that chemical
imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. A regular
everyday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the
body at all.

The pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)
on the level of circulating Thyroxin (there are two types T3 and T4 -
one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in
the liver). The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other
hormones (estrogen, for example). Naturally, changing activity of the
body's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, but
the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in
short order.

Good sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual (a physician's
reference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-)
and the Encyclopedia Brittanica (should be available in your local
library).

I hope this has been of some help.

I have this same alarm installed in my Syclone.  It works great.  The shock
sensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I have
on my other car.  It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind,
but any kind of shock sets it off.  Even kicking the tire sets it off.  It
works great.

The shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it.  You can adjust
it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without
setting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the
Syclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false
alarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has
been activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's
cause and it was not a false alarm.

I guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tight
in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are
supplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't
have one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm
won't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.

This is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked at
this feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want
to get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so
that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that
would trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.
I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you
leave the top down on.

Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks to
people as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids would
taunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. 
The owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.
>

I am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tune
it to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disable
the chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the
alarm is armed/disarmed.  

I like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine
flashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to be
careful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your
keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you are
meticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest.

I looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, but
more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. 
The shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle)
than the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good
value for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is. 
Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only. 
Anyone know where we can get one of those installed?  Maybe that was what they
had in the van in the World Trade Center, huh?>

I haven't read this entire thread, but, if someone hasn't tossed this out yet, then here it is: 

2 Samuel 12:21-23 (RSV) : 

  ""Then his servants said to him, `What is this thing that you have
  done? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but when
  the child died, you arose and ate food.' He [David] said, 'While the
  child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, 'Who knows
  whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?' But
  now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall
  go to him, but he will not return to me.'""

Anyhow, many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to Heaven
(where David will someday go). I don't claim to know for sure if this
applies to all babies or not. But even if it's just this one, what
would you say to this?

If you were to start your own religion, this would be fine.  But there
is no scriptural basis for your statement, in fact it really gets to
the heart of the problem.  You think you know more than scripture.
Your faith is driven by feel goodism and not by the Word of God.  Just
because they are nice people doesn't make it right.  You can start all
the churches you want and it won't change the fact that it is wrong.
That is not to imply that gays don't deserve the same love and
forgiveness that anyone else does.  But to call their behavior right
just because they are nice people is baseless, and it offers Satan a
perfect place to work because there is no check on what he is doing.
